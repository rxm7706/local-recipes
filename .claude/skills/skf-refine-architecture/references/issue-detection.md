# Step 3: Issue Detection

## STEP GOAL:

Find contradictions between what the architecture document claims and what the generated skills reveal about actual API surfaces. Detect language boundary issues not addressed, protocol mismatches assumed away, and missing bridge layers. If a VS feasibility report is available, incorporate RISKY and BLOCKED verdicts as confirmed issues.

## Rules

- Focus only on contradictions between architecture claims and skill API reality
- Do not detect gaps (Step 02) or suggest expansions (Step 04)
- Every issue must cite both the architecture claim and the contradicting skill evidence

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Reference Refinement Rules

Use the refinement rules loaded in Step 01 from `{refinementRulesData}`. If not available in context, reload from `{refinementRulesData}`.

Extract: issue classification (API Mismatch, Protocol Contradiction, Language Boundary Ignored, Type Incompatibility) and VS report integration rules.

### 2. Extract Integration Claims from Architecture

Parse the architecture document for specific claims about how technologies interact.

**Claim types to extract:**
- **API claims:** "Library X provides/exposes/exports {function/endpoint}"
- **Protocol claims:** "Library X communicates via {protocol}"
- **Data flow claims:** "Data flows from X to Y as {format}"
- **Integration claims:** "X and Y integrate through {mechanism}"
- **Capability claims:** "Library X handles {capability}"

For each claim, record:
- The exact text or paraphrase from the architecture
- The section where it appears
- The libraries referenced

### 3. Verify Claims Against Skill API Surfaces

For each extracted claim, verify against the compact API surfaces already collected in Step 02 §4 — the per-skill `{skill_api_surfaces}` summaries (`{exports, protocols, data_formats}`), carried forward as workflow state exactly like `{in_scope_skills}`. Reload a skill's SKILL.md directly only if its summary is unavailable or context has compacted (see Step 02 §4 for the canonical delegate-the-read pattern). Then check:

**API Mismatch check:**
- Does the claimed API actually exist in the skill's export list?
- Does the function signature match what the architecture describes?
- If the architecture describes an API that does not appear in the skill: flag as issue

**Protocol Contradiction check:**
- Does the skill document the protocol the architecture assumes?
- If the architecture claims gRPC but the skill shows HTTP-only: flag as issue

**Language Boundary check:**
- If two libraries are in different languages, does the architecture describe a bridge mechanism?
- If the architecture assumes direct calls across language boundaries without FFI/IPC: flag as issue

**Type Incompatibility check:**
- Does the architecture assume type compatibility that the skills contradict?
- If Library A exports Type X but the architecture claims Library B consumes it, and Library B expects Type Y: flag as issue

### 4. Incorporate VS Report (If Available)

If `vs_report_available` is true:

**Scope filter (reuse `{out_of_scope_skills}` from Step 02 §2b):** The VS report carries verdicts across the entire skill set, which may exceed this architecture's surface. Before promoting any verdict, check the pair's scope — if a verdict is for an **out-of-scope** pair (either library in `{out_of_scope_skills}`), do not promote it to an issue for this architecture; record it under the informational Out-of-Scope bucket instead. Only **in-scope** pairs' verdicts are promoted by the rules below.

**Load the VS feasibility report and extract verdicts:**
- **Risky verdicts** (match case-insensitively): Promote to confirmed issues with the VS evidence as additional citation
- **Blocked verdicts** (match case-insensitively): Promote to critical issues requiring architecture redesign
- **Plausible verdicts:** Note informatively — Plausible is not an issue by itself. Only flag as a potential issue if the VS rationale text explicitly states "no direct API evidence" or "weak evidence"

**For each VS-sourced issue, include dual citations:**
- Evidence from the skill content
- Verdict and rationale from the VS report

If `vs_report_available` is false: Skip this section. Issue detection proceeds with skill data only.

### 5. Document Each Issue

For each detected issue, cite it in this format:

```
**[ISSUE]**: {description}

Architecture states: "{quoted claim from original document}" (Section: {section_name})
Skill reality: {skill_name} exports: `{actual_api}` — {explanation of contradiction}
{IF VS report}: VS verdict: {Risky|Blocked} for {pair} — {VS rationale}

Suggestion: {specific correction with API evidence}
```

**Severity classification:**
- **Critical:** Blocked VS verdicts, fundamental language barriers with no bridge
- **Major:** Risky VS verdicts, protocol mismatches, missing bridge layers
- **Minor:** Plausible VS verdicts where the VS rationale explicitly states "no direct API evidence" or "weak evidence", minor type differences with easy conversion

### 6. Report Issues & Store Findings

Report the in-scope issue count with its critical/major/minor breakdown, then list each issue as a row of **# / Libraries / Issue Type / Severity / Summary** followed by its full §5 citation. One signal is not inferable from the counts and must survive regardless of format:

- **Out-of-scope VS verdicts were set aside (from §4):** list them separately for awareness only — they were not counted as issues — and note that re-running with `--scope-skills` pulls any that belong into scope.

Store the **in-scope** issue findings per the Finding Storage rule (refinement rules), under a `<!-- [RA-ISSUES] ... -->` block (its citations carry the architecture claim, skill evidence, VS verdict, severity, and suggestion). Record any out-of-scope VS verdicts under the shared `<!-- [RA-OUT-OF-SCOPE] ... -->` marker so Step 05 leaves them out — informational only.

### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step

Load, read the full file and then execute `{nextStepFile}`.
