# Step 5: Compile

## STEP GOAL:

To assemble the complete skill content from the extraction inventory and enrichment annotations — building SKILL.md sections, context-snippet.md, metadata.json, and references/ content according to the agentskills.io format.

## Rules

- Focus only on assembling content from extraction inventory + enrichment
- Do not include any content without a provenance citation
- Write all compiled artifacts to the staging directory `_bmad-output/{skill-name}/`. Do not write to `skills/` or `forge-data/` — step 7 promotes staged artifacts to their final versioned locations.
- Do not fabricate examples not found in source tests or docs
- Seed `<!-- [MANUAL] -->` markers for future update-skill compatibility

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Load Data Files

Load `{skillSectionsData}` and `{assemblyRulesData}` completely. These define the agentskills.io-compliant format and detailed assembly rules for all output artifacts.

### 1a. Create Staging Directory

Create `_bmad-output/{skill-name}/` (and `_bmad-output/{skill-name}/references/`). All artifacts produced in sections 2–7 below are written here:

- `SKILL.md`
- `context-snippet.md`
- `metadata.json`
- `references/*.md`
- `provenance-map.json`
- `evidence-report.md`

This is the `<staging-skill-dir>` referenced by step 6 (`npx skill-check check`, `npx -y tessl skill review`). Step-07 reads from the in-context copies (resynced by step 6 after any `--fix` modifications) and writes to the final versioned layout.

### 1b. Signature Fidelity Rule

**When assembling function signatures, parameter lists, and return types in any SKILL.md section or reference file:**

- **T1 provenance-map entries (AST-extracted) are authoritative** for: function name, parameter names, parameter types, parameter order, return type, and optionality markers (e.g., `?`, `Optional`, `= default`).
- **T2 (QMD-enriched) and T3 (doc-derived) sources may add** contextual descriptions, usage notes, behavioral documentation, and examples to function entries, but must not replace structural signature data from T1 entries.
- **On conflict:** If a T2/T3 source provides a different signature than the T1 extraction for the same export (e.g., different parameter count, different types, missing `Partial<>` wrapper), keep the T1 signature and log a warning in the evidence report: "Signature conflict for `{export_name}`: T1 shows `{t1_signature}`, T2/T3 shows `{other_signature}`. T1 used as authoritative."
- **`signature_source` field:** Record `signature_source: "T1" | "T1-low" | "T2" | "T3"` in each provenance-map entry to indicate the highest-confidence tier that contributed the structural signature data (params, return_type). This enables test-skill to verify signature provenance.

This rule applies to every section including Tier 1 Key API Summary, Tier 2 Full API Reference, and Section 4b Migration & Deprecation Warnings.

### 2. Build SKILL.md Content

Assemble each section in order using the assembly rules data file (`{assemblyRulesData}`). The data file specifies frontmatter format, Tier 1 section details (Sections 1-8, including conditional Section 7b for scripts/assets), Tier 2 section details (Sections 9-11), and assembly ordering rules. Follow it exactly. Assemble Section 7b (Scripts & Assets) only if `scripts_inventory` or `assets_inventory` is non-empty.

**Shape-specific overrides:** the assembly-rules file defines gated override blocks for `component-library`, `reference-app`, and **whole-language reference** skills. Apply the override whose gate matches this brief. A whole-language reference is gated on `assembly_shape: "whole-language-reference"` (a `doc_urls` entry with `source: language-registry`, as step 3c §1 determined and as `skf-derive-assembly-shape.py` reports) and uses the `language_guide[]` artifact step 3c §4a retained — it foregrounds the Language Guide and demotes compiler internals. When no override gate matches, assemble the standard library-export layout unchanged.

### 2a. Description Sanitization Pass

**Before writing SKILL.md frontmatter to disk**, sanitize the assembled `description` string by replacing every `<` with `{` and every `>` with `}`. Apply this pass unconditionally to the final assembled description in context, then write the result to `SKILL.md`.

**Why unconditional?** Both `skill-check`'s `description_field` validator and `tessl`'s deterministic description check parse the frontmatter `description` as a raw string — they reject any `<` or `>` regardless of whether the content is inside a backtick span or a generic expression. The previous rule exempted backticked content on the assumption that backticks protect from XML-tag parsing, but that assumption is false for these validators: a backticked TypeScript generic like `` `Meta<typeof X>` `` still fails tessl's check because tessl reads the raw string before markdown parsing. Unconditional replacement guarantees no angle brackets reach either validator.

**Scope:** This rule applies **only** to the frontmatter `description` field. Body content, code examples, reference files, and assembly-rule documents retain their original angle brackets — they are parsed through the markdown AST where backticks do protect content.

Record the count of substitutions in context as `description_sanitizations: {count}` for the evidence report.

If a downstream tool re-introduces angle brackets into the description, step 6 §6 recovers via `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` in `assets/tessl-dismissal-rules.md`.

### 3. Build context-snippet.md Content

Vercel-aligned indexed format for CLAUDE.md managed section (~80-120 tokens):

```markdown
[{skill-name} v{version}]|root: skills/{skill-name}/
|IMPORTANT: {skill-name} v{version} — read SKILL.md before writing {skill-name} code. Do NOT rely on training data.
|quick-start:{SKILL.md#quick-start}
|api: {top exports with () for functions, comma-separated}
|key-types:{SKILL.md#key-types} — {inline summary of most important type values}
|gotchas: {2-3 most critical pitfalls or breaking changes, inline}
```

**Derivation rules:**

- **version**: From source detection (reconciled in step 3), not brief default
- **api**: Top 10 exports from extraction inventory, append `()` to function names
- **key-types**: Inline summary of most important enum/type values from Key Types section
- **gotchas**: Derived from T2-future annotations (breaking changes), async requirements, version-specific behavior changes. If no gotchas available, omit the gotchas line.
- **Section anchors** (`#quick-start`, `#key-types`): Must match actual heading slugs in the assembled SKILL.md

### 4. Build metadata.json Content

Following the structure from the skill-sections data file:
- Populate all fields from brief_data, extraction inventory, and tier
- Set `generation_date` to current ISO-8601 timestamp
- Set `source_commit` from resolved source (if available)
- Set `source_ref` from resolved source ref (tag name, branch, or `HEAD`; null if unavailable)
- Set `scope_type` from the brief's `scope.type` value verbatim (`full-library`, `specific-modules`, `public-api`, `component-library`, `reference-app`, or `docs-only`). **Always emit this field.** `skf-test-skill` keys reference-app handling on `metadata.json.scope_type == "reference-app"` — both the scoring redistribution (Signature Accuracy / Type Coverage marked N/A) and the coverage-check §4b count-coherence skip. Omitting it silently mis-scores a reference-app skill as a library (zero-export barrel HALT or false metadata-drift findings). The value is informational for the other scope types (consumers only branch on `reference-app`), but emit it for all so the producer/consumer contract holds.
- **Compute the `stats` block and `confidence_distribution` deterministically** with `{renderMetadataStatsHelper}` (resolve from `{renderMetadataStatsProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins). The helper owns all the arithmetic — binning each provenance entry once by its `signature_source` tier, summing the bins, and computing every coverage ratio — and returns the finished `stats` + `confidence_distribution` objects to write into `metadata.json` verbatim. Run `uv run {renderMetadataStatsHelper} --help` for the full contract. You supply only the judgment payload below.

  **Judgment payload (what you decide — passed as JSON on stdin):**
  - `exports_public_api`: count of exports from public entry points (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`, or equivalent) — derive this from step 3's entry-point validation (section 4b), not from the provenance-map entry count (which may be incomplete if extraction patterns missed some export types)
  - `exports_internal`: count of all other non-underscore-prefixed exports (internal modules, helpers, adapters)
  - `scripts` / `assets`: the `scripts_inventory` / `assets_inventory` arrays (or `[]` when empty) — the helper sets `stats.scripts_count` / `stats.assets_count` from their lengths
  - `effective_denominator` (**optional** — include in the helper's judgment payload only for stratified-scope monorepo packages): the count of public exports from files matched by the brief's authoring-surface globs, filtered by `scope.exclude`, resolved against `source_path`. **Prefer `scope.tier_a_include` when the brief supplies it** — that narrow list represents the authoring surface the brief intends to document; resolve its globs across `source_path` and count the union of **named exports** — items reachable from the language's public entry-point barrel (`lib.rs` `pub use`, `index.ts` / `index.js` re-exports, `__init__.py` exports), where a type counts **once** with its methods and impl-block members rolling up under it (count a `pub fn` only when it is a free function reachable from the barrel, never a method on an already-counted type). **Otherwise use `scope.include`** — the coarse list. This counting unit matches what `skf-test-skill` re-derives on the consumer side (`coverage-check.md` §2c excludes `kind: "method"` from `documented_set`), so the producer- and test-side denominators stay aligned; without it, a type-heavy API (a few handle types carrying hundreds of methods) inflates the denominator by an order of magnitude and auto-fails the coverage gate. This is the coverage denominator `skf-test-skill` uses when the package is a curated subset of a multi-package repository, so it must match the brief's authoring intent. Compute when ALL of the following hold:
    1. The source is a monorepo (detected via `packages/` layout, `workspaces` field in root `package.json`, `lerna.json`, `rush.json`, `nx.json`, or Cargo `[workspace]`).
    2. `scope.type` is not `full-library` (and not `reference-app` — see carve-out below), AND the resolved include list (`tier_a_include` if present, else `scope.include`) lists a curated file/directory subset rather than the full workspace.
    3. `scope.notes` is present and documents the stratification strategy (e.g., a tiered A/B/C plan) — this serves as the intent marker confirming the subset is by design.

    Otherwise omit it from the payload entirely — when absent, `skf-test-skill` falls back to `exports_public_api`. See `skf-test-skill` `references/source-access-protocol.md` §Source API Surface Definition ("Stratified-scope monorepo packages") for the test-side consumption rules.

    **Reference-app carve-out:** never emit `effective_denominator` for `scope.type: "reference-app"`, even when the three conditions above are literally satisfied (a reference-app-in-monorepo matches all of them). A reference app's coverage basis is `pattern_surfaces_documented`, not library exports — see the Reference-App stats semantics in `assets/compile-assembly-rules.md`.
- **Shape:** pass `--shape reference-app` or `--shape stack` when the matching assembly-rules override applies (default `library`). For a reference app, also put `pattern_surfaces_documented` (the Pattern Surface row count) in the payload — the helper uses it as `exports_documented`, emits `stats.pattern_surfaces_documented`, and refuses to emit `effective_denominator`; the distribution then sums to the per-citation count, not to `exports_documented`. For a stack, put the own-barrel `exports_documented` (usually `0`) in the payload; the distribution sums to the cited-constituent count.
- **Invoke** — stage `provenance-map.json` (§6) first, since the helper reads its `entries[]`:

  ```bash
  echo '{"exports_public_api": {N}, "exports_internal": {M}, "scripts": {scripts_inventory-or-[]}, "assets": {assets_inventory-or-[]}}' \
    | uv run {renderMetadataStatsHelper} <staging-skill-dir>/provenance-map.json
  ```

  Write the returned `stats` and `confidence_distribution` verbatim. The helper derives `exports_documented` (the documented-export count = provenance `entries[]` count), `exports_total` = `exports_public_api` + `exports_internal`, `public_api_coverage` = documented / public_api (`null` if public_api is 0), `total_coverage` = documented / total (`null` if total is 0), and bins `confidence_distribution.{t1, t1_low, t2, t3}` by each entry's `signature_source` — **each entry counted exactly once**, so the four bins provably sum to the documented-export count. This structurally prevents the recurring miscount where binning ~8 T2 annotations + ~80 T3 doc items on top of 59 exports produced a distribution summing to 147 ≠ 59 (`skf-test-skill` coverage-check §4b flags that sum as an internal-consistency defect). If the helper reports `coherence.ok: false`, some provenance entries carry a missing/unrecognized `signature_source` (or a file-entry count disagrees) — fix the provenance map, do not hand-edit the stats.
- Set `description` from the SKILL.md frontmatter `description` field (already assembled in section 2)
- Set `language` from source analysis (e.g., `"typescript"`, `"python"`) — use the primary language of the entry point file
- Set `ast_node_count` from extraction stats if ast-grep was used (Forge/Deep tier), otherwise omit
- Set `tool_versions` based on tier and available tools. Resolve `{skf_version}` using this resolution chain (try each in order, use the first that succeeds):
  1. `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/package.json` → read `.version` field
  2. `node -p "require('./node_modules/bmad-module-skill-forge/package.json').version"`
  3. `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/VERSION` → read plain text file (single line containing version string, written by the SKF installer)
  4. `"unknown"` (final fallback — add a warning to the evidence report)
  Never hardcode the version.
- Resolve `{ast_grep_version}` using this resolution chain (try each in order, use the first that succeeds):
  1. `ast-grep --version` → parse version string from output (e.g., `ast-grep 0.41.1` → `"0.41.1"`)
  2. `mcp__ast-grep__find_code` tool metadata (if version is exposed by the MCP server)
  3. `"unknown"` (final fallback — add a warning to the evidence report)
- Resolve `{qmd_version}` using this resolution chain (try each in order, use the first that succeeds):
  1. `qmd --version` → parse version string from output (e.g., `qmd 2.0.1` → `"2.0.1"`)
  2. `mcp__plugin_qmd-plugin_qmd__status` → parse version if exposed in status output
  3. `"unknown"` (final fallback — add a warning to the evidence report)
  Note: QMD is a Bun/Node package (`@tobilu/qmd`). Install via `bun install -g @tobilu/qmd`.
- Store `commit_short` = first 8 characters of `source_commit` (or `"unknown"` if unavailable) for use in step 8 report.
- If `scripts_inventory` is non-empty, populate the `scripts[]` array (per-file `{file, purpose, source_file, confidence}` rows). If `assets_inventory` is non-empty, populate the `assets[]` array. Omit the `scripts[]` / `assets[]` arrays entirely when their inventory is empty — `stats.scripts_count` / `stats.assets_count` were already set by `{renderMetadataStatsHelper}` from the `scripts` / `assets` payload you passed it (0 when empty).

### 5. Build references/ Content

Create one reference file per major function group or type:
- Full function signatures with detailed parameter descriptions
- Complete usage examples (from source only)
- Related functions cross-references
- Temporal annotations (Deep tier: T2-past, T2-future)

Group functions logically by module, file, or functional area.

### 6. Build provenance-map.json Content

One entry per extracted export: export_name, export_type, params[] (typed strings), return_type, source_file, source_line, confidence tier (T1/T1-low/T2), extraction_method, ast_node_type, signature_source ("T1"|"T1-low"|"T2"|"T3" — indicates which tier contributed the structural signature).

**File entries** — emit one `file_entries[]` row per tracked non-code file when any of these inventories are non-empty:

- `scripts_inventory` → `file_type: "script"`, `extraction_method: "file-copy"`, stored in `{skill_package}/scripts/` by step 7
- `assets_inventory` → `file_type: "asset"`, `extraction_method: "file-copy"`, stored in `{skill_package}/assets/` by step 7
- `promoted_docs` (from step 3 §2a) → `file_type: "doc"`, `extraction_method: "promoted-authoritative"`, **not** copied into the skill package by step 7. The source file stays at its original path; only the provenance tracking entry is written. `content_hash` was pre-computed by §2a.

Each `file_entries[]` row has the same shape regardless of `file_type`: `{file_name, file_type, source_file, content_hash, confidence, extraction_method}`. See `{skillSectionsData}` for full schema and the canonical list of `file_type` values.

### 7. Build evidence-report.md Content

Compilation audit trail: generation date, forge tier, source info, tool versions, extraction summary (files/exports/confidence), warnings. For validation-specific fields (Schema, Body, Security, Content Quality, tessl, Metadata), insert the placeholder text `[PENDING — populated by step 6]`. Step-06 will replace these placeholders with actual results. See `{skillSectionsData}` for full template. Use the same `{skf_version}` value resolved in section 4 when populating the Tool Versions block.

**Frontmatter — pinned fields:** emit YAML frontmatter at the top of `evidence-report.md` with at minimum `skill_name`, `generated`, `forge_tier`, and `t2_future_count`. Compute `t2_future_count` as the count of forward-looking (T2-future) temporal annotations in the enrichment data produced by step 4 (`qmd query` + temporal classification). **Emit `t2_future_count: 0` when no T2-future annotations exist** — omission is indistinguishable from "no data" for downstream consumers and would silently flip the skf-test-skill §2b/§5b migration-section gate into Case 2/3 for a Case-1 skill. This frontmatter is the authoritative detection contract — `migration-section-rules.md` Case Rules parse it deterministically rather than grepping prose.

**Auto-Decisions section (render from the durable sink):** render the `## Auto-Decisions` section into `evidence-report.md` from the **union of the on-disk auto-decision sink** (`{sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl`, established at step 1 §3 and appended to on every gate landing) **and the in-context `headless_decisions[]` buffer** — read the sink's JSON lines, union them with the buffer keyed on `step`+`gate` so nothing is duplicated or dropped, and emit one row per entry in the table format documented in step 6 §8. The sink is authoritative: on a long component-library run the in-context buffer may have compacted across the token-heavy step 3→5 extraction window, but the sink carries every decision written as it landed (step 1 tier-override, step 2 ecosystem gate, step 3 zero-exports, step 3d component-extraction gates). This step is the first point `evidence-report.md` is written to disk (staging dir, §8 below). Exactly one gate can still fire after this step — step 6 §6b (the tessl-suggestions gate) — and step 6 §8 re-reconciles idempotently. If the union is empty (no decision has fired), emit the section with the single line `No auto-decisions — workflow ran interactively (or all gates had no match to auto-resolve).` — step 6 §8 replaces that line if a later decision lands.

### 8. Auto-Proceed

No user interaction. Once all content is assembled in context and written to the staging directory `_bmad-output/{skill-name}/` (no final files in `skills/` or `forge-data/` yet), load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it. `extraction-rules.yaml` is generated by step 7 from extraction data — do not create it here.
