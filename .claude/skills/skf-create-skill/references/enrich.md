# Step 4: Enrich

## STEP GOAL:

To enrich the extraction inventory with temporal context from QMD knowledge searches — issues, PRs, changelogs, and migration notes that add T2-confidence annotations to extracted functions. Deep tier only; Quick, Forge, and Forge+ tiers skip this step entirely.

## Rules

- Focus only on QMD searches to annotate extracted functions — enrichment is additive only
- Do not begin compilation (Step 05)
- QMD failures degrade gracefully — continue without enrichment
- Quick, Forge, and Forge+ tiers: skip this step entirely, auto-proceed

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Check Tier Eligibility

**If tier is Quick, Forge, or Forge+:**

Auto-proceed silently. Display no message. Immediately load, read entire file, then execute `{nextStepFile}`.

**If tier is Deep:**

Continue to step 2.

### 2. Collection Inventory Pre-check (Deep Tier Only)

Before searching, check which QMD collections are available:

1. Read the sidecar `forge-tier.yaml` to get registered `qmd_collections` entries
2. Identify which collections contain enrichment context — collections with `type` equal to `"temporal"` (issues, PRs, changelogs) or `"docs"` (fetched external documentation). Do not include `"extraction"` or `"brief"` type collections.
3. **If no enrichment collections exist** (no `"temporal"` or `"docs"` type collections): report this and auto-proceed. Display:

"**Enrichment: no enrichment collections available.**
Only brief-type or extraction-type QMD collections found — no temporal context (issues, PRs, changelogs) or docs collections indexed. {IF extraction_mode is 'docs-only' AND T3 items exist in extraction_inventory: 'T3 documentation content is available in extraction inventory — enrichment via QMD is skipped but T3 content will be compiled.'} {ELSE: 'Enrichment skipped (expected for first-run skill creation). Enrichment becomes available when temporal or docs context is indexed into QMD collections.'}

Proceeding to compilation..."

Then immediately load, read entire file, then execute `{nextStepFile}`.

4. **If temporal collections exist:** Continue to step 3.

### 3. QMD Enrichment Searches (Deep Tier Only)

For each major exported function — limited to the **top-level public API surface** (typically 10-20 functions that will appear in the context-snippet), not all extracted exports — search the temporal QMD collections for context:

**Search query construction:**

For each function, derive the **module context** from the extraction inventory's source file path (e.g., `src/graph/neo4j/index.ts` → module context `graph neo4j`). This context improves search relevance by scoping results to the function's subsystem without adding extra queries.

**Primary searches (BM25 — always runs, no GPU/VRAM dependency):**

1. **Issues/PRs:** `qmd_bridge.query(searches=[{type:'lex', query:'{module_context} {function_name}', intent:'issues-prs'}])` — find related discussions scoped by module context
2. **Changelog entries:** `qmd_bridge.query(searches=[{type:'lex', query:'{function_name} changelog', intent:'changelog'}])` — find version history, breaking changes (kept generic — changelogs rarely use module paths)
3. **Migration notes:** `qmd_bridge.query(searches=[{type:'lex', query:'{function_name} migration deprecated breaking', intent:'migration'}])` — find deprecation or migration context using exact keyword matching

**Supplemental search (best-effort — requires GPU/VRAM, may fail):**

4. **Semantic migration context:** `qmd_bridge.query(searches=[{type:'vec', query:'{module_context} {function_name} migration deprecated', intent:'semantic-migration'}])` — adds semantic matches (synonyms, paraphrases) that BM25 keyword search may miss. Merge results with search #3, deduplicating by document ID. If the `vec`-type search fails (VRAM, GPU driver, model loading), discard silently — the BM25 (`lex`) results from search #3 provide baseline coverage.

**Tool resolution for qmd_bridge:** QMD MCP exposes a single `query` tool that accepts a `searches[]` array. Each entry has a `type` field — `'lex'` for BM25 keyword search, `'vec'` for semantic vector search, `'hyde'` for hypothetical-document retrieval — plus `query` and `intent` fields. Claude Code: `mcp__plugin_qmd-plugin_qmd__query`. Cursor: qmd MCP server. CLI: `qmd search "{query}"` (BM25) / `qmd vector-search "{query}"` (semantic). See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

**Tool probe (graceful degradation):** If any tool-not-found error surfaces while invoking `query` (e.g., legacy `vector_search` still expected by an older client, or a bridge returns "tool not registered"), treat it as a non-fatal failure for that function's enrichment and continue with the remaining functions. Do not retry against the stale `vector_search` tool name — that name was removed from the QMD MCP server. Record the degradation in context for the evidence report.

**For each QMD result:**

- Create a T2 annotation: `[QMD:{collection}:{doc}]`
- Classify temporal relevance:
  - **T2-past:** Historical context (why it was built, what it replaced)
  - **T2-future:** Forward-looking context (planned changes, deprecation warnings)

**Handling QMD failures:**

- If qmd_bridge is unavailable: skip all enrichment, note in context
- If individual search fails: skip that function's enrichment, continue with others
- If QMD returns no results for a function: no annotation added (absence is normal)

### 4. Annotate Extraction Inventory

Add enrichment annotations to the extraction inventory without modifying extraction data:

**Per-function enrichment (if found):**
- Related issues/PRs with summary
- Changelog history (version changes, breaking changes)
- Migration/deprecation context
- T2 provenance citation for each annotation

**Enrichment summary counts:**
- Functions enriched: {count} of {total}
- T2 annotations added: {count}
- T2-past annotations: {count}
- T2-future annotations: {count}

### 5. Report Enrichment (Deep Tier Only)

Display brief enrichment summary:

"**Enrichment complete.**

**Functions enriched:** {enriched_count} of {total_count}
**T2 annotations:** {t2_count} ({t2_past} historical, {t2_future} forward-looking)

Proceeding to compilation..."

### 6. Auto-Proceed

No user interaction. After enrichment completes (or is skipped for non-Deep tiers), load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.
