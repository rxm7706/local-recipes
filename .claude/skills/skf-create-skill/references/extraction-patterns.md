# Extraction Patterns by Tier

## Quick Tier (No AST)

Source reading via gh_bridge — infer exports from file structure and content.

### Strategy
1. `gh_bridge.list_tree(owner, repo, branch)` — map source structure
2. Identify entry points: index files, main exports, public modules
3. `gh_bridge.read_file(owner, repo, path)` — read each entry point
4. Extract: exported function names, parameter lists, return types (from signatures)
5. Infer types from JSDoc, docstrings, type annotations in source

### Confidence
- All results: T1-low (source reading without structural verification)
- No co-import detection available
- No AST-backed line numbers

### Supported Patterns
- `export function name(...)` / `export const name = ...` (JS/TS)
- `pub fn name(...)` (Rust)
- `def name(...)` with `__all__` (Python)
- `func Name(...)` (Go, capitalized = exported)

---

## Forge Tier (AST Available)

Structural extraction via ast-grep — verified exports with line-level citations.

> **Note:** `ast_bridge.*`, `qmd_bridge.*`, and `ccc_bridge.*` references below are **conceptual interfaces**, not callable functions. Resolve them as follows:
> - `ast_bridge.*` → ast-grep MCP tools (`mcp__ast-grep__find_code`, `mcp__ast-grep__find_code_by_rule`) or `ast-grep` CLI
> - `qmd_bridge.*` → QMD MCP `query` tool (`mcp__plugin_qmd-plugin_qmd__query`) taking `searches=[{type:'lex'|'vec'|'hyde', query, intent}]`, or `qmd` CLI (`qmd search` / `qmd vector-search`). The legacy `vector_search` MCP tool has been removed; if a client surfaces a tool-not-found error, degrade gracefully per the QMD step 4 tool-probe note — do not retry the stale name.
> - `ccc_bridge.*` → `/ccc` skill (Claude Code), ccc MCP server (Cursor), or `ccc` CLI
> - `gh_bridge.*` → `gh api` commands or direct file I/O for local sources
>
> See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md` for the complete resolution table. Also see the AST Extraction Protocol section below and the TOOL/SUBPROCESS FALLBACK rule for dispatch details.

### Strategy

1. Detect language from brief or file extensions
2. Use ast-grep to extract all exports from `path` for the given `language` (scan definitions)
3. For each export: function name, full signature, parameter types, return type, line number
4. Use ast-grep to detect co-imported symbols in `path` for the given `libraries[]`
5. Build extraction rules YAML for reproducibility

### Confidence
- Exported functions with full signatures: T1 (AST-verified)
- Type definitions and interfaces: T1
- Co-import patterns: T1
- Internal/private functions: excluded (not part of public API)

### ast-grep Patterns
- JS/TS: `export function $NAME($$$PARAMS): $RET` / `export const $NAME = ($$$PARAMS) => $BODY` / `export const $NAME` / `export class $NAME`
- Rust: `pub fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) -> $RET`
- Python: function definitions within `__all__` list
- Go: capitalized function definitions

---

## Forge+ Tier (AST + CCC)

Identical extraction to Forge tier. CCC adds an upstream semantic discovery step that pre-ranks the file extraction queue.

### When CCC Pre-Discovery Applies

CCC pre-discovery runs in ccc-discover (before this extraction step) when ALL of the following are true:
- Tier is Forge+ or Deep
- `tools.ccc: true` in forge-tier.yaml
- `ccc_index.status` is `"fresh"`, `"stale"`, `"created"`, or `"none"`/`"failed"` (step 2b attempts lazy indexing for the latter two)

The discovery step stores `{ccc_discovery: [{file, score, snippet}]}` in context. This extraction step consumes those results to pre-rank the file list.

### CCC Pre-Ranking Strategy

When `{ccc_discovery}` is present and non-empty:

1. Files appearing in `{ccc_discovery}` results move to the front of the extraction queue, sorted by relevance score descending
2. Files not in CCC results remain in the queue — they are not excluded, only deprioritized
3. If the CCC intersection with scoped files produces <10 files: include all scoped files (CCC results too narrow)
4. Proceed with the AST Extraction Protocol on the pre-ranked list

### ast-grep Patterns

Same patterns as Forge tier — see Forge tier section above. CCC pre-ranking does not change which AST patterns are used, only which files are processed first.

### Confidence

All results: T1 (AST-verified) — identical to Forge tier. CCC is upstream discovery only and is invisible in the output artifact.

### Important

CCC pre-discovery failures (ccc unavailable, command error, empty results) always result in standard Forge extraction behavior. This is not reported to the user as a problem — it is normal behavior when ccc has no relevant results for the skill's scope.

---

## Deep Tier (AST + QMD)

Same extraction as Forge tier. Deep tier adds enrichment in step 4, not extraction.

### Strategy
- Identical to Forge tier extraction
- QMD enrichment happens in the next step (enrich)
- Extraction results carry forward unchanged

### Confidence
- Extraction: same as Forge (T1)
- Enrichment annotations added in step 4: T2

---

## AST Extraction Protocol

When AST tools are available (Forge/Deep tier), follow this deterministic protocol to prevent output overflow on large codebases.

**"Files in scope"** = files remaining after applying `include_patterns` and `exclude_patterns` from the brief, filtered by the target language extension. This is not the total repository file count from step 1's tree listing. Use the filtered count from step 3 section 2 as the decision tree input.

### Decision Tree

Apply the first matching condition:

```
Files in scope ≤ 100
  → Use ast-grep MCP tool: find_code(pattern, max_results=100, output_format="text")
  → Parse compact text output directly into extraction inventory

Files in scope 101–500
  → Use ast-grep MCP tool: find_code_by_rule(yaml, max_results=150, output_format="text")
  → Use scoped YAML rules (see recipes below) to filter at the AST level
  → Parse compact text output into extraction inventory

Files in scope > 500
  → CLI streaming fallback: ast-grep run --json=stream + line-by-line Python processing
  → Process in directory batches, cap per-batch output
  → Merge batch results into extraction inventory
```

### Safety Valve

If any ast-grep operation (MCP or CLI) visibly causes a timeout, returns an error related to output size, or produces unexpectedly large output: immediately switch to the CLI streaming fallback with `--json=stream`. Do not retry the same approach. When falling back to the CLI streaming template, inject the brief's `scope.exclude` patterns into the `EXCLUDES` list (use `[]` if absent) — this applies regardless of which path triggered the fallback. Note: `max_results` in the MCP tool and `| head -N` in the CLI path provide hard caps, but this safety valve covers cases where the upstream tool itself fails before returning results (e.g., OOM during JSON serialization).

### MCP Tool Usage (Preferred)

**Simple pattern search:**

```
find_code(
  project_folder="{source_path}",
  pattern="async def $NAME($$$PARAMS)",
  language="python",
  max_results=100,
  output_format="text"
)
```

**Scoped YAML rule search (for larger repos):**

```
find_code_by_rule(
  project_folder="{source_path}",
  yaml="id: public-api\nlanguage: python\nrule:\n  pattern: 'def $NAME($$$PARAMS)'\n  inside:\n    kind: module\n    stopBy: end\nconstraints:\n  NAME:\n    regex: '^[^_]'",
  max_results=150,
  output_format="text"
)
```

### CLI Streaming Fallback

When MCP tools are unavailable or the repo exceeds 500 files in scope, use `--json=stream` (not `--json` or `--json=pretty`, which load the whole result set into memory) with line-by-line Python processing:

**Head cap selection:** The `| head -N` cap at the end of the pipeline controls how many exports are captured. Select `N` based on scope and tier:
- **Default (Quick/Forge, any scope):** `N = 200`
- **Forge+/Deep with `scope.type: "full-library"`:** `N = 500`
- **Forge+/Deep with `scope.type: "component-library"`:** `N = 300` (components have fewer but richer exports; props interfaces are the primary API surface)

For full-library skills at higher tiers, the larger cap prevents silently dropping internal module exports that maintainers need. The cap is applied AFTER exclude-pattern filtering, so useful results are not wasted on excluded files.

```bash
# Note: use $$$ for variadic params in ast-grep patterns (e.g., 'def $NAME($$$PARAMS)')
# {exclude_patterns} = Python list from brief's scope.exclude, e.g. ['tests/**', '**/test_*']
# If scope.exclude is absent or empty in the brief, inject [] as the default.
# Patterns are matched against the full file path as emitted by ast-grep.
# Ensure paths are relative to the same root as the patterns (strip ./ prefix if needed).
# {HEAD_CAP} = 200 (default) or 500 (Forge+/Deep full-library) — see head cap selection above.
# IMPORTANT: The explicit 'run' subcommand is required for --json=stream to work.
ast-grep run -p '{pattern}' -l {language} --json=stream {path} | python3 -c "
import sys, json, fnmatch, signal
signal.signal(signal.SIGPIPE, signal.SIG_DFL)

EXCLUDES = {exclude_patterns}

for line in sys.stdin:
    try:
        m = json.loads(line)
        f = m.get('file','')
        if EXCLUDES and any(fnmatch.fnmatch(f, pat) for pat in EXCLUDES):
            continue
        v = m.get('metaVariables',{})
        name = v.get('single',{}).get('NAME',{}).get('text','')
        if name and not name.startswith('_'):
            ln = m.get('range',{}).get('start',{}).get('line',0)+1
            sig = m.get('text','').split(chr(10))[0].strip()
            print(f'[AST:{f}:L{ln}] {sig}')
    except: pass
" | head -{HEAD_CAP}
```

**Streaming constraints (these prevent OOM on large result sets):**

- Use `--json=stream`, not `--json` — the latter loads the entire array into memory
- Process line-by-line (`for line in sys.stdin`), not `json.load(sys.stdin)`
- Cap output with `| head -N` as a safety valve
- For repos > 500 files, process in directory batches of 20-50 files each: split by top-level source directory, run the CLI streaming template per batch with the same head cap, then merge results and deduplicate by export name (keep the first occurrence if duplicates exist across batches)

### YAML Rule Recipes by Language

**Python — public functions:**

```yaml
id: python-public-functions
language: python
rule:
  pattern: 'def $NAME($$$PARAMS)'
  inside:
    kind: module
    stopBy: end
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '^[^_]'
```

**Python — public classes:**

```yaml
id: python-public-classes
language: python
rule:
  pattern: 'class $NAME'
  kind: class_definition
  inside:
    kind: module
    stopBy: end
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '^[^_]'
```

> **Pattern note:** The minimal `class $NAME` pattern (with `kind: class_definition` to disambiguate the AST node) works on ast-grep 0.42.x via both MCP `find_code_by_rule` and CLI `--json=stream`. The previously documented `class $NAME($$$BASES)` and `class $NAME($$$BASES):` variants are known-broken on 0.42.x — see Known Limitations #7 below. For simple CLI extraction without a YAML rule, use `ast-grep run -p 'class $NAME' -l python --json=stream {path}` and post-filter names via the `^[^_]` regex in the Python processing step of the CLI streaming template.

**JavaScript/TypeScript — exported functions:**

> **Language selection:** Use `language: typescript` for `.ts` files and `language: tsx` for `.tsx` files. Patterns that work with `typescript` may return zero results with `tsx` and vice versa — they use different tree-sitter parsers. For mixed codebases, run each pattern twice (once per language) and merge results. Note: the `export function $NAME($$$PARAMS)` pattern returns **zero** with `tsx` on ast-grep 0.41.x (see Known Limitation #5) **and** with plain `typescript` on 0.42.x (see Known Limitation #9) — use source reading as the fallback for `export function` on both.

```yaml
id: js-exported-functions
language: typescript  # Use 'tsx' for .tsx files — see language selection note above
rule:
  pattern: 'export function $NAME($$$PARAMS)'
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript — exported constants:**

```yaml
id: js-exported-constants
language: typescript
rule:
  pattern: 'export const $NAME = $VALUE'
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript — exported arrow functions:**

```yaml
id: js-exported-arrow-functions
language: typescript
rule:
  pattern: 'export const $NAME = ($$$PARAMS) => $BODY'
```

> **JS/TS Pattern Merging:** Modern TypeScript codebases often use `export const` exclusively for all exports (arrow functions, objects, constants). Run ALL four JS/TS patterns (functions, arrow functions, constants, classes) and merge results by `$NAME`. Priority when deduplicating: arrow function match > function declaration match > constant match. Arrow function matches capture parameters directly; constant matches require inspecting `$VALUE` to extract signatures.

**JavaScript/TypeScript — exported classes:**

```yaml
id: js-exported-classes
language: typescript
rule:
  pattern: 'export class $NAME { $$$ }'
```

> **Important:** The body (`{ $$$ }`) is required on ast-grep 0.42.x. The bare `export class $NAME` pattern returns zero matches — and emits a `Pattern contains an ERROR node` warning — through **both** `find_code()` and the CLI, because an incomplete class declaration does not parse as a complete statement (see Known Limitation #9). With the body present, the simple `find_code()` pattern detects class exports reliably — it matches non-generic classes only; generic (`export class $NAME<T>`) and generic-extends (`export class $NAME<T> extends $BASE`) forms are skipped, so source-read them via `^export (abstract )?class` and merge by name+file (see Known Limitation #10). `find_code_by_rule` would additionally require an explicit AST `kind` rule.

**JavaScript/TypeScript — re-export detection (use `find_code`):**

Use `find_code()` with pattern `export { $$$NAMES } from $SOURCE` for re-export detection. Note: this pattern may produce multiple AST node matches. Post-process results to split comma-separated names from `$$$NAMES`. For complex re-export chains (aliased exports, default re-exports, namespace re-exports), fall back to the Re-Export Tracing protocol in `extraction-patterns-tracing.md`.

**Rust — public functions:**

```yaml
id: rust-public-functions
language: rust
rule:
  any:
    - pattern: 'pub fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) -> $RET'
    - pattern: 'pub fn $NAME($$$PARAMS)'
```

**Go — exported functions (capitalized):**

```yaml
id: go-exported-functions
language: go
rule:
  any:
    - pattern: 'func $NAME($$$PARAMS) $RET'
    - pattern: 'func $NAME($$$PARAMS)'
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '^[A-Z]'
```

### Component Library YAML Rule Recipes

These patterns are used by `component-extraction.md` when `scope.type: "component-library"`. They prioritize Props interfaces and PascalCase component exports.

**React/TypeScript — Props interfaces (primary API contracts):**

```yaml
id: react-props-interfaces
language: typescript  # Use 'tsx' for .tsx files
rule:
  pattern: 'export interface $NAME { $$$ }'
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '.*Props$'
```

**React/TypeScript — Component function exports (PascalCase):**

> **Language note:** Use `language: tsx` for `.tsx` files. The `export function` pattern may fail with tsx on ast-grep 0.41.x (see Known Limitations #5). Use `export const` patterns as primary and fall back to source reading for `export function` in tsx files.

```yaml
id: react-component-functions
language: tsx
rule:
  pattern: 'export function $NAME($$$PARAMS)'
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '^[A-Z]'
```

**React/TypeScript — Component arrow function exports:**

```yaml
id: react-component-arrow-functions
language: typescript
rule:
  pattern: 'export const $NAME = ($$$PARAMS) => $BODY'
constraints:
  NAME:
    regex: '^[A-Z]'
```

**Vue — defineProps extraction:**

```yaml
id: vue-define-props
language: typescript
rule:
  pattern: 'defineProps<$TYPE>()'
```

**Props-to-Component linking strategy:**

After extracting Props interfaces and component exports, link them using this 3-level fallback chain:

1. **Naming convention (primary):** Strip `Props` suffix from interface name → match to component export (e.g., `NativeLiquidButtonProps` → `NativeLiquidButton`)
2. **File co-location (fallback):** If naming doesn't match, check if a Props interface and a PascalCase export function are defined in the same file — link them
3. **Generic parameter (deep fallback):** Search for `ComponentProps<typeof $NAME>` or `React.ComponentProps<typeof $NAME>` patterns that reference the component by name

Unlinked Props interfaces are included as standalone type exports. Unlinked component exports are included with a note that no Props interface was found (signature-only, T1-low confidence for API contract).

### Known ast-grep Limitations

When using ast-grep for extraction, be aware of these documented limitations:

1. **`export class $NAME` needs a body on 0.42.x; `find_code_by_rule` needs explicit `kind`:** The bare `export class $NAME` pattern returns zero through **both** `find_code()` and the CLI on ast-grep 0.42.x — add the body, `export class $NAME { $$$ }` (see #9). With `find_code_by_rule`, a class export additionally needs a `kind` rule for the tree-sitter node type; the simpler `find_code()` with the body-form pattern is the lighter path.

2. **Re-export patterns produce multiple AST nodes:** `export { A, B, C } from './module'` decomposes into multiple metavariable bindings for `$$$NAMES`. Results require post-processing to split comma-separated names.

3. **Default anonymous exports capture no name:** `export default function $NAME` works, but `export default $EXPR` (anonymous default export) captures no name in `$NAME`. Fall back to source reading (T1-low) for anonymous defaults.

4. **Fallback protocol:** If an ast-grep pattern returns errors or zero results when results are expected:
   - First: retry with `find_code()` using a simpler pattern (drop type annotations, use broader match)
   - Second: if `find_code()` also fails, fall back to source reading for that pattern category (T1-low confidence)
   - Never silently accept zero results for a pattern category that the source language commonly uses

5. **TSX `export function` pattern failure:** The `export function $NAME($$$PARAMS)` pattern may return zero results in TSX files with ast-grep 0.41.x. This affects both MCP tools and CLI. `export const` and `export type` patterns are unaffected. **Workaround:** For TSX files, use `export const` patterns first (which work), then fall back to source reading (grep/file read) for `export function` declarations. When a TSX codebase shows zero `export function` matches but source files clearly contain them, this is a known ast-grep tree-sitter tsx parser limitation — not an extraction error. Log it in the evidence report and proceed with T1-low confidence for those exports.

6. **CLI `--json=stream` may produce no output:** On ast-grep 0.41.x, `--json=stream` may produce empty output for certain patterns. The `--json=stream` flag requires the explicit `run` subcommand: use `ast-grep run -p '{pattern}' --json=stream` (not `ast-grep -p '{pattern}' --json=stream`). If streaming still produces no output, fall back to the MCP tool or source reading.

7. **Python class patterns with bases/colon return zero (ast-grep 0.42.x):** The patterns `class $NAME($$$BASES)` and `class $NAME($$$BASES):` return zero matches on real Python sources with ast-grep 0.42.0, even on files containing dozens of subclassed public classes. `find_code_by_rule` also rejects the bare inline rule without `kind` as `Rule must specify a set of AST kinds to match. Try adding \`kind\` rule.` **Workaround:** Use the minimal `class $NAME` pattern with `kind: class_definition` (YAML) or `ast-grep run -p 'class $NAME' -l python --json=stream` (CLI), then post-filter names via the `^[^_]` regex. The `^[^_]` constraint enforces the "public" filter since ast-grep's base-match rule is what's broken, not the name-match rule. See the Python — public classes recipe above.

8. **Rust `pub fn` any-pattern returns zero; bare `pub fn $NAME` over-captures (ast-grep 0.42.x):** The `rust-public-functions` recipe's `any:` of `pub fn $NAME($$$PARAMS) -> $RET` / `pub fn $NAME($$$PARAMS)` returns "No matches found" on real Rust sources with ast-grep 0.42.2, even on crates containing 200+ public functions. Dropping to the bare `pub fn $NAME` pattern matches, but over-captures restricted-visibility functions such as `pub(crate) fn` / `pub(super) fn`, which are **not** public API. **Workaround:** Prefer a visibility-constrained source grep — `rg '^\s*pub fn ' <src>` filtered to exclude lines beginning `pub(` — cross-checked against the AN-verified public surface, at T1-low confidence. Never silently accept zero results for Rust public functions, and never treat a bare `pub fn $NAME` match set as the public API without stripping `pub(...)`-restricted items. See the Rust — public functions recipe above.

9. **Plain `language: typescript` declaration patterns without a body return zero (ast-grep 0.42.x):** For `language: typescript` on ast-grep 0.42.2, the incomplete-statement patterns `export class $NAME`, `export function $NAME($$$PARAMS)`, `export type $NAME`, and `export enum $NAME` all return **zero** matches against real `.ts` sources — `export class` / `export type` / `export enum` additionally print `Pattern contains an ERROR node`. This affects the CLI (`ast-grep run -p ... -l typescript`) and the MCP `find_code()` API **identically** — `find_code()` is not a workaround. Only `export const $NAME = $VALUE` matches as documented. The cause is that a declaration pattern missing its body/initializer does not parse as a complete statement. **Workarounds (verified on 0.42.2 via both CLI and `find_code`):**
   - **class:** add the body — `export class $NAME { $$$ }` matches.
   - **enum:** add the body — `export enum $NAME { $$$ }` matches.
   - **type alias:** drop `export` and include the initializer — `type $NAME = $T` matches (and captures both `export type` and bare `type` declarations).
   - **interface:** `export interface $NAME { $$$ }` already carries a body and **works** for plain interfaces — but it misses generic (`interface $NAME<T>`) and `extends` forms; source-read those at T1-low.
   - **function:** the body form `export function $NAME($$$PARAMS) { $$$ }` matches only functions with no return-type annotation and no `async` modifier, so it is unreliable. Prefer a source-read fallback (or a barrel cross-check) at T1-low for `export function`, mirroring the tsx guidance in #5.

   Never silently accept zero results for a declaration form the source language commonly uses.

10. **Generic class declarations do not match non-generic class patterns (ast-grep 0.42.x):** The non-generic patterns `export class $NAME { $$$ }` and `export class $NAME extends $BASE { $$$ }` silently skip every generic form on ast-grep 0.42.2 — verified via both the CLI (`ast-grep run -p ... -l typescript`) and `find_code()`, the first matched only a plain `Plain` and the second only a plain `PlainExtends` on a fixture of `Plain` / `Generic<T>` / `GenericExtends<T> extends Base<T>` / `abstract AbstractGeneric<T>` / `PlainExtends`. The per-shape generic patterns `export class $NAME<$$$P> { $$$ }`, `export class $NAME<$$$P> extends $BASE { $$$ }`, and `export abstract class $NAME<$$$P> { $$$ }` each match exactly **one** shape — no single pattern covers all of them. **Workaround:** Always run a source-read fallback `^export (abstract )?class` over the in-scope `.ts` sources (T1-low) and merge by name+file with the AST results, mirroring the `export function` guidance in #9. The bare `class $NAME` pattern catches every form but over-captures non-exported classes, so it still needs the source-read pass to re-impose the exported-only filter — this is the opposite trade from the Python #7 `^[^_]` re-filter, since TS has no name-prefix convention for exports. Never accept a class inventory that omits generic classes when the source uses them.

### Component Library Demo/Example Auto-Exclusion

When `scope.type: "component-library"`, auto-detect and propose demo/example exclusions before extraction begins. **User confirmation is required before applying** — some `examples/` directories contain API-level code.

**Auto-detect directory patterns:**
- `**/demo/**`, `**/demos/**`
- `**/stories/**`, `**/__stories__/**`, `**/storybook/**`
- `**/examples/**`, `**/example/**`

**Auto-detect file patterns:**
- `**/*.stories.*`, `**/*.story.*`
- `**/*.example.*`, `**/*.demo.*`

If `demo_patterns` is specified in the brief, use those instead of auto-detection.

**Procedure:**
1. Scan the scoped file tree for matching directories and files
2. Count matches per pattern category
3. Present to user: "**Auto-detected {N} demo/example files** in {M} directories matching these patterns: {list}. Confirm exclusion? [Y/n] Or adjust patterns:"
4. Apply confirmed patterns to the exclude list before AST extraction
5. Record in extraction inventory: `demo_files_excluded: {count}`
