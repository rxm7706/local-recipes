# Step 3c: Fetch Remote Documentation

## STEP GOAL:

Fetch remote documentation from brief-specified URLs using whatever web fetching capability is available in the agent's environment, extract API information, and add T3-confidence content to the extraction inventory. Tool-agnostic — the agent uses Firecrawl, WebFetch, web-reader, curl, or any available web tool.

## Rules

- No tier gate — runs at any tier when `doc_urls` are present in the brief
- Tool-agnostic — use whatever web fetching capability is available
- Do not halt the workflow if web fetching is unavailable or fails
- Do not override existing T1, T1-low, or T2 extraction data with T3 content

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Check Eligibility

Evaluate the following conditions. **If the condition fails, skip silently to section 7 (auto-proceed) with no output:**

1. **`doc_urls` is present in the brief data:** Check that `doc_urls` contains at least one URL entry from step 1 context. If `doc_urls` is absent or empty, skip silently.

No tier gate — if `doc_urls` are present, this step runs at Quick, Forge, and Deep tiers alike.

**Determine assembly shape (whole-language gate).** Resolve `{deriveAssemblyShapeHelper}` from `{deriveAssemblyShapeProbeOrder}` (first existing path wins) and run it on the brief:

```bash
uv run {deriveAssemblyShapeHelper} {brief_path}
```

If the result's `assembly_shape` is `whole-language-reference` (the brief carries ≥1 `doc_urls` entry with `source: language-registry` — a compiler/interpreter repo enriched with the language's canonical prose), set the in-context flag `whole_language_reference: true`. This changes ONLY how the registry-sourced corpora are handled below (§4a): their prose is retained as a **Language Guide** rather than shredded into per-export items. For every other brief the flag is false and this step behaves exactly as before — no change to ordinary skills.

### 2. Security Notice

Display an informational notice (not a gate — the user already approved these URLs in the brief):

"**Documentation fetch:** The following external URLs will be fetched:
{for each URL: `- {label}: {url}`}

Content fetched from external URLs is classified as **T3** (external, untrusted) and cited as `[EXT:{url}]`."

### 3. Fetch Documentation

**Discover available web fetching capability.** Try tools in any order — use whatever is accessible in the current environment (e.g., Firecrawl scrape, WebFetch, web-reader, MCP fetch, curl, browser tools). If no web fetching capability can be found:

- Log warning: "No web fetching capability available in this environment. Skipping documentation fetch."
- Skip to section 7 (auto-proceed).

**For each URL in `doc_urls`:**

- Fetch the content at `{url}` as clean markdown using the discovered web tool.
- **If fetch succeeds:** Store the markdown content with the URL as provenance source.
- **If fetch fails:** Log warning: "Failed to fetch {url}: {reason}. Skipping." Continue with remaining URLs.

**Subpage discovery (root URL detection):**

After fetching a URL, apply the following heuristic to detect documentation root pages that contain no useful API content. This is common with modern documentation sites (Mintlify, Docusaurus, ReadTheDocs, GitBook) that render API content on subpages.

**Root page detection — apply only when the URL path ends in `/`, `/index`, `/index.html`, has no path component (bare domain), or has 1 path segment (e.g., `/docs`). For deeper URL paths (2+ segments like `/api/reference`), skip this heuristic and keep the content as-is.**

Subpage discovery is triggered if **either** of the following independent triggers fires:

**Trigger 1 — Content-based (both conditions must be true):**

1. **Zero API content indicators:** The fetched markdown contains none of: fenced code blocks (`` ``` ``), parameter tables (`|---|`), or function signature patterns (`def `, `function `, `fn `, `func `, `export `).
2. **High link density:** More than 70% of non-empty lines are markdown links (matching `[text](url)` with no other substantive content on the line).

**Trigger 2 — URL-based (independent of content analysis):**

The URL matches the path criteria above (ends in `/`, bare domain, or 1 segment) AND the fetched content is under **2000 words**. Short content on root-like URLs almost certainly indicates a navigation hub or landing page, even if it contains introductory code examples that would prevent Trigger 1 from firing. This handles modern doc sites (Mintlify, Docusaurus, GitBook) that include hero sections with code snippets on their root pages.

If neither trigger fires, keep the page content as-is and do not trigger subpage discovery.

**If a root URL with minimal content is detected:**

1. **Attempt sitemap/map discovery:** Use whatever discovery tool is available:
   - Firecrawl: `firecrawl_map({url})` to discover all subpages
   - Manual: try fetching `{url}/sitemap.xml` and parsing URLs from it
   - Crawl: if a crawl tool is available, use it with depth=1 on the root URL
   - If no discovery tool is available, keep the root page content as-is and continue

2. **Filter discovered URLs by relevance and origin:** Restrict candidates to the same **registrable domain** as the root URL — strip the URL down to its eTLD+1 (e.g., for root `https://docs.example.com/intro`, accept any subdomain of `example.com` such as `api.example.com` or `docs.example.com`, but reject `example.org` or `cdn.partner.io`). Cross-origin links must be discarded before any fetch. The same-registrable-domain rule prevents Mintlify/Docusaurus link clouds from pulling in tracking pixels, doc-site CDNs, or third-party embeds as if they were canonical docs. From the surviving same-domain candidates, select the most relevant pages by searching for API-related terms in the URL path or title (e.g., `api`, `reference`, `quickstart`, `setup`, `config`, `getting-started`, `guide`, `sdk`, `methods`, `functions`). Exclude pages that are clearly non-API content (e.g., `blog`, `changelog`, `pricing`, `about`, `careers`).

3. **Fetch top subpages (in parallel):** Fetch up to **10** of the most relevant subpages **concurrently** — subpage fetches are independent and network-bound, so wall-clock benefits substantially from parallel execution. Bound concurrency to **4 in flight** at a time to stay polite to documentation hosts (Mintlify/Docusaurus typically allow more, but conservatism here protects against unrecognized rate limits).

   The parallel pattern depends on the fetch tool:

   - **LLM-driven tools** (Firecrawl `firecrawl_scrape`, `WebFetch`, MCP fetch, browser tools): issue up to 4 tool calls **in a single message**. The agent runtime executes parallel tool calls concurrently; collect results from the batch before issuing the next set of up to 4. Repeat until all up-to-10 subpages have been attempted or rate limiting halts the batch.
   - **Bash-driven tools** (`curl`, `wget`): use `xargs -P 4 -n 1` to fan out from a newline-separated subpage list. Example:

     ```bash
     printf '%s\n' "${subpages[@]}" | xargs -P 4 -n 1 -I {} bash -c '
       url="{}"
       safe=$(echo -n "$url" | sha256sum | cut -c1-12)
       curl -sSL --max-time 30 "$url" > "{staging}/subpage-$safe.md" \
         || echo "fetch failed: $url" > "{staging}/subpage-$safe.md"
     '
     ```

   For each subpage (regardless of tool):
   - Use the same web fetching tool as the root URL
   - Store with the subpage URL as provenance: `[EXT:{subpage-url}]`
   - If a subpage fetch fails, skip it and continue with the rest of the batch — do not halt the whole stage

4. **Rate limiting:** If rate limiting (HTTP 429) is encountered during subpage fetching, stop discovery for this root URL. Keep results collected so far. Log: "Subpage discovery stopped due to rate limiting." For the parallel-tool-call pattern, drop any not-yet-issued tool calls from subsequent batches; for the `xargs` pattern, interrupt the pipeline (set `--max-procs 0` is **not** a graceful stop — the simplest stop is to kill the xargs PID and let in-flight writers complete naturally).

**If ALL URLs fail (including any subpage fetches):** Log warning: "No documentation could be fetched. Proceeding without T3 content." Skip to section 7 (auto-proceed).

### 4. Extract API Information from Fetched Content

Parse the successfully fetched markdown for:

- **Function/method signatures** and their parameters
- **Return types** and data structures
- **Configuration options** and their defaults
- **Usage examples** and code snippets

**Citation rule:** Every extracted item gets a T3 confidence citation: `[EXT:{url}]` where `{url}` is the source URL the item was extracted from.

**No hallucination:** If information cannot be found in the fetched content, exclude it. Do not infer or fabricate API details.

**Whole-language references — retain prose, do not shred (`whole_language_reference: true`):** For a whole-language reference the registry-sourced corpora (the guide/Book, the standard/library docs) ARE the product, not the compiler's internal exports. Reducing that prose to per-export signature items and then discarding it under the §5 "T3 never overrides T1" rule (the compiler's AST already owns names like `Vec`, `Option`, `HashMap`) would gut exactly the content the skill exists to teach. So for these briefs, skip §4a below for the registry corpora.

### 4a. Retain the Language Guide (whole-language references only)

**Skip this section entirely unless `whole_language_reference: true`.** When it is true, for each `doc_urls` entry whose `source` is `language-registry`:

- Do not reduce its fetched markdown to per-export items. Instead retain the cleaned prose as a Language-Guide entry `{url, label, prose}`, where `prose` is the substantive body (narrative, idioms, usage examples, conceptual reference) lightly trimmed of navigation/boilerplate, each block cited `[EXT:{url}]`.
- Collect these into a `language_guide[]` context artifact, in `doc_urls` order.

This artifact is a **distinct** carrier — it is not merged into the extraction inventory and is not subject to the §5 conflict rule, so the canonical prose survives intact into step 5 (compile), which foregrounds it as the skill's Language Guide. Non-registry docs (README-detected, homepage, Pages, docs-folder) still flow through §4's normal per-export extraction and the §5 merge unchanged.

**If a registry corpus could not be fetched** (network failure), record it in `language_guide[]` as `{url, label, prose: null}` and warn — step 5 surfaces the gap rather than emitting a thin guide silently.

### 5. Build Doc-Fetch Inventory

**Mode determines merge behavior:**

- **`source_type: "docs-only"`** — The doc-fetch inventory IS the extraction inventory. It replaces the empty inventory from step 3, since there was no source code to extract from.
- **`source_type: "source"` (supplemental mode)** — Merge T3 items into the existing extraction inventory from step 3.

**Conflict rule:** T3 items never override existing T1, T1-low, or T2 items for the same export. When an export already has a higher-confidence entry, the T3 item is discarded — T3 has the lowest priority.

**Language-Guide carve-out:** the `language_guide[]` artifact from §4a (whole-language references) is not part of the export inventory and is therefore not subject to this conflict rule — it carries no export key, so it cannot collide with a T1 compiler export and can never be pruned. It is passed separately into step 5, which renders it as the foregrounded Language Guide section. Only the per-export T3 items participate in the T1/T2/T3 merge.

**Edge case — T1-zero supplemental mode:** If T1 extraction produced zero results and `doc_urls` are present in supplemental mode, T3 items should be used as the primary inventory since no T1 data exists to conflict with.

**Aggregate totals for reporting:**
- URLs fetched successfully vs. total
- URLs that failed
- T3 items extracted

### 5b. Index into QMD (Deep Tier Only)

**If tier is not Deep:** Skip this section silently.

**If tier is Deep and at least one URL was fetched successfully:**

1. Write fetched markdown files to a staging directory: `_bmad-output/{skill-name}-docs/`
2. Index into QMD with atomic replace + rollback: if a `{skill-name}-docs` collection already exists, run `qmd collection remove {skill-name}-docs` first, then `qmd collection add {project-root}/_bmad-output/{skill-name}-docs/ --name {skill-name}-docs --mask "*.md"`. **If `qmd collection add` fails after a successful `remove`:** remove any matching `{skill-name}-docs` entry from `forge-tier.yaml` → `qmd_collections[]` to keep the registry consistent with QMD's actual state, warn in evidence-report, and skip the embed — docs enrichment degrades gracefully.
3. Generate embeddings scoped to this collection (only if step 2 `add` succeeded): `qmd embed --collection {skill-name}-docs` (required for semantic `type:'vec'` and HyDE `type:'hyde'` sub-queries within the QMD `query` tool). If the installed `qmd` CLI does not accept `--collection`, gate the embed behind a freshness check: skip re-embedding if the existing `{skill-name}-docs` registry entry is within 24 hours, and log the skip in the evidence report to prevent unbounded batch-mode re-embedding.
4. Register in forge-tier.yaml `qmd_collections` array — **acquire an exclusive `flock` on `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml.lock` for the read-modify-write** (see the locking pattern documented in step 3b §4). Write via `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`. If `flock` is unavailable, fall back to read-CAS-by-mtime (capture `st_mtime` before, re-check after; refuse to clobber if a concurrent run wrote in between).

```yaml
- name: "{skill-name}-docs"
  type: "docs"
  source_workflow: "create-skill"
  skill_name: "{skill-name}"
  created_at: "{current ISO date}"
```

5. Clean up staging directory after indexing: `rm -rf {project-root}/_bmad-output/{skill-name}-docs/`

**If QMD indexing fails:** Warn: "QMD indexing of fetched docs failed. T3 items are still in the extraction inventory — enrichment will proceed without QMD-indexed docs." Continue.

### 6. Report

Display:

"**Documentation fetch complete.**
**URLs processed:** {fetched}/{total}
**T3 items extracted:** {count}
**Confidence:** All doc-fetched items are T3 — `[EXT:{url}]` citations applied.
{If docs-only mode: '**Mode:** Docs-only — all skill content is T3. source_authority: community'}

Proceeding to enrichment..."

### 7. Auto-Proceed

No user interaction. After the fetch completes or is skipped for any reason, load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.
