# Step 6: Validate

## STEP GOAL:

To validate the compiled SKILL.md content against the agentskills.io specification using skill-check, auto-fix any validation failures, and confirm spec compliance before artifact generation.

## Rules

- Focus only on validating compiled content against spec — only fix spec compliance issues
- Validation and auto-fix modify files in the staging directory
- `<staging-skill-dir>` resolves to `_bmad-output/{skill-name}/` as created by step 5. The directory name must match the skill's frontmatter `name` field exactly — `skill-check`'s `frontmatter.name_matches_directory` rule rejects any suffix.
- If skill-check unavailable: skip validation, add warning to evidence report
- Ignore non-zero exit codes from skill-check if JSON output shows 0 errors

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 0. Description Guard Protocol

**Used by:** §2 (`skill-check check --fix`), §4 (`split-body`), and any future tool invocation that may modify SKILL.md.

Load `{descriptionGuardProtocol}` for the full prose explanation of the four-phase guard (why it exists, what counts as divergence, why token-stream comparison is the right shape). The deterministic phases are executed via `{descriptionGuardHelper}` — the calling sections (§2 and §4) invoke the helper at the capture and verify-restore points.

**This skill's post-restore re-validation hook:** after `{descriptionGuardHelper}` reports `restored: true`, resolve `{frontmatterValidator}` from `{frontmatterValidatorProbeOrder}` (first existing path wins), run `uv run {frontmatterValidator} <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md` and capture `schema_revalidation_result` in context. If the validator exits non-zero OR reports failure for the `description` field, flip the Schema result back to `FAIL` in the evidence report (overriding any prior PASS/WARN from §2), record `description_guard_revalidation: FAIL` with the validator's diagnostic message, and continue — do not halt (step 9 health-check and result contract still need to run so the failure is surfaced through the normal artifact path).

### 1. Check Tool Availability

Run: `timeout 30s npx skill-check -h` — the short timeout protects against a cold `npx` download blocking the workflow indefinitely on a slow network.

- If succeeds: Continue to automated validation (section 2)
- If fails or times out: Perform manual fallback (section 3); add note to evidence-report: "Spec validation performed manually — skill-check tool unavailable". Also set `metadata.validation_status: 'manual-only'` in `metadata.json` (write via `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target <staging-skill-dir>/metadata.json`), and in the evidence-report's `Validation Results` section mark Security, Body, and Content Quality (tessl) rows explicitly as `skipped — skill-check unavailable`. Downstream consumers (pipeline, forger, test-skill) check `validation_status` to decide how much weight to put on the artifact; leaving it unset would make a manual-only run look equivalent to a fully automated PASS.

**Important:** Do not assume availability — empirical check required.

### 2. Validate & Auto-Fix (skill-check check --fix)

Run the external skill-check tool against the compiled skill staging directory.

**Flag probe (run once, cache the result for §4 and §5 re-invocations):**

```bash
npx skill-check check --help 2>/dev/null | grep -- --no-security-scan
```

- If the probe matches `--no-security-scan`: set `{security_scan_flag} = "--no-security-scan"`.
- Else run a second probe — `npx skill-check check --help 2>/dev/null | grep -- --skip-security` — and if it matches, set `{security_scan_flag} = "--skip-security"`.
- If neither flag exists: set `{security_scan_flag} = ""` (empty) AND set `{skill_check_flag_fallback} = true`. Skip §2 and §4 automated flows entirely — fall through to §3 manual frontmatter validation. Record in evidence-report: `skill_check_flag_probe: neither --no-security-scan nor --skip-security supported by installed skill-check; validation performed manually`.

**If a security-scan-disable flag was resolved (probe succeeded):**

```bash
npx skill-check check <staging-skill-dir> --fix --format json {security_scan_flag}
```

This performs frontmatter validation, description quality checks, body limit enforcement, local link resolution, file formatting, auto-fix of deterministic issues, and quality scoring (0-100) across five weighted categories.

**Parse the JSON output** for: `scores[].score` (0-100 — match the entry by `relativePath`/`skillId`; falls back to a top-level `qualityScore` on older skill-check builds), `diagnostics[]` (remaining issues), `fixed[]` (auto-corrected issues).

**Description Guard Protocol:** This invocation may modify SKILL.md (especially when `fixed[]` is non-empty). Wrap the `skill-check check --fix` call in the four-phase guard defined in §0 by invoking `{descriptionGuardHelper}` at the capture and verify-restore points:

```bash
# Phase 1 — capture before the tool call
uv run {descriptionGuardHelper} capture <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md
# stash the returned `description` as `guarded_description` in workflow context

# Phase 2 — run skill-check (see command block above)

# Phases 3+4 — verify and restore after the tool call
uv run {descriptionGuardHelper} verify-restore <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md \
    --captured-description "{guarded_description}"
```

If `restored: true` in the verify-restore output, apply §0's post-restore re-validation hook. If `fixed[]` was non-empty in the skill-check output, also re-read the modified SKILL.md to sync the in-context copy before proceeding — this prevents silent divergence between the in-context and on-disk versions that step 7 will use for artifact generation.

**Note:** `skill-check` may return non-zero exit code even when `summary.errorCount` is 0. Always rely on parsed JSON, not the shell exit code.

- **Score ≥ 70:** Record "Schema: PASS (score: {score}/100)" in evidence-report
- **Score < 70:** Log remaining diagnostics as warnings, record "Schema: WARN — score {score}/100, {count} remaining issues", proceed
- **Unfixable errors:** Record specific rule IDs and suggestions, proceed with warnings

### 3. Validate Frontmatter (Fallback)

**If skill-check was available:** Skip — already validated in step 2.

**If skill-check not available (fallback):** Perform manual frontmatter compliance check:

- [ ] Frontmatter present — file starts with `---` and has closing `---`
- [ ] `name` field — present, non-empty, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only, 1-64 chars
- [ ] `name` matches skill output directory name
- [ ] `description` field — present, non-empty, 1-1024 characters
- [ ] No unknown fields — only `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` permitted
- [ ] `version` and `author` are not in frontmatter (they belong in metadata.json)

If fails: auto-fix (deterministic), re-validate once, record result. If passes: record "Frontmatter: PASS".

### 4. Split Oversized Body (if needed)

**If step 2 reported `body.max_lines` failure:**

**Description Guard Protocol:** Split operations may rewrite the frontmatter. Wrap the split invocation in the four-phase guard defined in §0:

```bash
# Phase 1 — capture before the split
uv run {descriptionGuardHelper} capture <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md
# stash returned `description` as `guarded_description`

# Phase 2 — run the split (selective extraction or, last-resort, split-body --write)

# Phases 3+4 — verify and restore after the split
uv run {descriptionGuardHelper} verify-restore <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md \
    --captured-description "{guarded_description}"
```

If `restored: true` in the verify-restore output, apply §0's post-restore re-validation hook.

**Mandatory approach — selective split:** Identify Tier 2 sections by their `## Full` heading prefix (e.g., `## Full API Reference`, `## Full Type Definitions`, `## Full Integration Patterns`). Extract ONLY those sections to `references/`, starting with the largest. Keep ALL Tier 1 content and any smaller sections inline. Inline passive context achieves 100% task accuracy vs 79% for on-demand retrieval (per Vercel research).

This selective split is deterministic — run `{shardBodyHelper}` (the same splitter step 5b auto-shard uses) rather than counting and extracting by hand. **Resolve `{shardBodyHelper}`** from `{shardBodyProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins.

```bash
uv run {shardBodyHelper} <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md --budget 400
```

It extracts the largest `## Full` sections to `references/` until the body fits, rewrites each as a cross-reference blockquote through the atomic-write helper, and reports `sections_extracted`, `body_lines_after`, `tier1_preserved`, `xref_ok`, and `under_budget`.

**Do not run `npx skill-check split-body --write` before selective extraction.** It extracts every `##` section top-to-bottom, destroying the Tier 1 inline content the two-tier design depends on — a last resort used only after selective split has been attempted and proven insufficient.

**If selective split alone does not bring body under the limit** (the splitter reports `under_budget: false` — rare, typically only when Tier 1 itself exceeds 300 lines): reduce Tier 1 Key API Summary and Architecture at a Glance sections to fit within limits. Do not fall back to automated `split-body --write` to solve a Tier 1 sizing problem.

**Tier 1 preservation check:** After any split operation, verify that all of the following Tier 1 sections remain inline in SKILL.md (not moved to references/): Overview, Quick Start, Common Workflows, Key API Summary, Migration & Deprecation Warnings (if present), Key Types, Architecture at a Glance, CLI (if present), Scripts & Assets (if present), Manual Sections. If any was moved to references/, restore it immediately and re-split targeting only Tier 2 sections.

**Post-split Tier-1 count check (mandatory):** do not recount Tier-1 headings by hand — consume the splitter's `tier1_preserved` field. `{shardBodyHelper}` compares the Tier-1 headings inline before extraction against those inline afterward and reports `tier1_preserved` (with any pulled headings in `tier1_missing`). Read it from the invocation above, or re-check any split's result with `uv run {shardBodyHelper} <staging-skill-dir>/SKILL.md --dry-run`. **HALT** if `tier1_preserved` is false with: "Split reduced Tier-1 section count (missing {tier1_missing}). Tier-1 sections must remain inline. Restoring from staging backup and aborting body split — manual review required." Do not proceed past §4 — Tier-1 preservation is a hard invariant and a `tier1_preserved: false` result means the splitter pulled an inline section into references/ regardless of the section-list check above (e.g., heading-text variation, capitalization, or the splitter's own heuristics).

**Anchor validation and remediation:** After any split, verify that context-snippet section anchors (`#quick-start`, `#key-types`) still resolve to headings in SKILL.md. If an anchor no longer resolves (section was split out), restore that section to SKILL.md inline content — the context-snippet must always reference sections that exist in the main file.

Then re-validate: `npx skill-check check <staging-skill-dir> --format json {security_scan_flag}` — use the flag cached from §2's probe. If `{skill_check_flag_fallback}` is true, skip re-validation and rely on the §3 manual check.

**If skill-check unavailable or no body size issue:** Skip.

### 5. Security Scan

**If skill-check available:**

```bash
npx skill-check check <staging-skill-dir> --format json
```

(Security scan enabled by default when `--no-security-scan` omitted. The scan uses [Snyk](https://docs.snyk.io/) to check for prompt injection risks, sensitive data exposure, and unsafe tool permissions.)

Record any security warnings in evidence-report. Security findings are advisory — they do not block artifact generation. If the full validation re-run produces a different quality score than section 2, update the evidence-report with the newer score.

**If security scan fails due to missing SNYK_TOKEN:**

Display: "Security scan requires a Snyk Enterprise API token ([docs](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-api/authentication-for-api)). Set `SNYK_TOKEN=your-token` in environment or `.env`, then re-run [SF] Setup Forge. Without Enterprise, use `--no-security-scan` to skip. Security scanning is optional and does not block skill compilation."

Record: "Security scan skipped — SNYK_TOKEN not configured"

**If skill-check unavailable:** Skip with note: "Security scan skipped — skill-check tool unavailable"

### 6. Content Quality Review (tessl)

**If tessl available**, run: `timeout 120s npx -y tessl skill review <staging-skill-dir>` — the 120s cap matches skf-test-skill's tessl invocation guard and prevents a stalled LLM call in tessl from blocking compilation. On timeout, treat the step as unavailable and record `tessl: timeout — content quality review skipped` in the evidence report.

Parse output for: `description_score`, `content_score`, `review_score`, `validation_result`, `judge_suggestions[]`.

**Load dismissal rules:** Before interpreting any findings, load `{tesslDismissalData}` completely. This file is the single source of truth for tessl findings that SKF expects and must dismiss. It defines score thresholds, suggestion dismissal patterns, and the action to take when each rule matches.

**Apply dismissal rules** in this order:

1. **Check score thresholds** against the "Score Thresholds" table in `{tesslDismissalData}`. Most importantly:
   - If tessl's output contains a `findings[]` entry with rule ID `description_field` (the deterministic angle-bracket / XML-tag validator): follow the **recover-then-halt** path defined by the `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` rule in `{tesslDismissalData}`. Re-apply step 5 §2a's `<`/`>` → `{`/`}` substitution in place on the staging SKILL.md frontmatter `description`, re-sync the in-context copy, and re-run `npx -y tessl skill review <staging-skill-dir>` once. **Re-run gate:** treat the `description_field` finding being **absent** from the re-run as the only successful recovery outcome. If the finding persists on the re-run — whether the re-substitution improved the description or not — that counts as recovery failure: halt with the original `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` failure message from `{tesslDismissalData}`, do not proceed to §6b, and do not downgrade the recovery to a warning. On successful recovery (finding cleared), log `description-recovery: applied ({count} substitutions)` in the evidence report under "Dismissed tessl suggestions" and continue suggestion iteration against the rerun's `judge_suggestions[]`.
   - If the LLM-judge `description_score` is below 100 **but no `description_field` finding is present** (the deterministic validator PASSED): this is a soft discoverability signal (jargon density, trigger-term phrasing) from the judge's sub-scores, not a sanitizer bypass. Record `description_judge_score: {n}% (deterministic description_field validator PASSED)` as a warning in the evidence report and continue — do not trigger the recover-then-halt path and do not halt.
   - If `review_score < 60` or `content_score < 60`: record warnings in the evidence report, continue.
2. **Iterate `judge_suggestions[]`.** For each suggestion:
   - Cross-reference against the rules in `{tesslDismissalData}` in order.
   - If a rule matches: record `{rule_id, rationale, suggestion_text}` under "Dismissed tessl suggestions" in the evidence report. Do not apply.
   - If no rule matches: add to the "Novel tessl suggestions" list for §6b to surface to the user.
3. **Short-circuit when empty.** If every suggestion was dismissed (no novel suggestions), §6b has nothing to show — auto-proceed to §7.

- **Unavailable:** Skip with note: "Content quality review skipped — tessl tool unavailable"

tessl installs automatically via `npx`. A missing tool is not an error — graceful skip.

#### 6b. User Decision Gate (conditional)

**If §6 produced no novel suggestions (all dismissed via `{tesslDismissalData}`) OR tessl was unavailable:** Skip this gate — auto-proceed.

**GATE [default: S]** — If `{headless_mode}` is true AND §6 produced novel suggestions: auto-select [S] Skip (a headless run has no human to triage novel suggestions), record `"tessl suggestions: {N} novel suggestion(s) auto-skipped (headless)"` in the evidence report under "Dismissed tessl suggestions", log `"headless: auto-skip {N} novel tessl suggestion(s)"`, and append `{step: "validate", gate: "tessl-suggestions", decision: "S", value: "{N} novel auto-skipped", rationale: "headless mode — no human to triage novel tessl suggestions", timestamp: {ISO}}` to the in-context `headless_decisions[]` list and, the moment it lands, append the same object as a JSON line to the durable audit sink `{sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl` (the on-landing append established at step 1 §3). §8 below reconciles the sink into the evidence-report `## Auto-Decisions` table — this is the last gate to fire; the earlier gates' rows are already in the sink and were rendered into the staged report at step 5 §7. This is the one consequential auto-decision that drops human-relevant feedback, so it must leave an audit row rather than vanishing. Then auto-proceed to §7 — do not present the menu below.

**If §6 produced novel suggestions** (ones not matched by any dismissal rule) AND `{headless_mode}` is false, present them to the user:

"**Content quality review: {score}%**

tessl suggestions (novel — not matched by `{tesslDismissalData}`):
{numbered list of novel suggestions}

**Select an option:**
- **[S] Skip** — proceed with current content as-is (default)
- **[A] Apply structural fixes** — apply only structural suggestions (split sections, consolidate duplicates). No new content generated.
- **[R] Review all** — show each suggestion with proposed changes before applying"

#### Gate Rules:

- **Structural suggestions** (split reference section, consolidate duplicates, reorder sections) can be applied without zero-hallucination risk — they restructure existing content
- **Semantic suggestions** (add examples, add error handling, add validation checkpoints) introduce content not verified from source code. If the user chooses to apply these:
  - Warn: "This adds content not verified from source code."
  - Mark applied content with `<!-- [TESSL:auto-fix] -->` markers
  - Cite as `[TESSL:suggestion]` in the provenance map with `confidence: "TESSL"` (below T3)
  - Record in evidence report: "TESSL-suggested content applied: {count} items (unverified)"
- **If user selects [S]:** Record "tessl suggestions: skipped by user" in evidence report. Proceed to section 7.
- **If user selects [A]:** Apply structural fixes only, re-run tessl to capture updated score, record results. Proceed to section 7.
- **If user selects [R]:** Show each suggestion with the proposed change. For each, user confirms or skips. Apply confirmed changes, record results. Proceed to section 7.

### 7. Validate metadata.json

**Re-derive the computed fields with `{renderMetadataStatsHelper}` in check mode** rather than re-doing the arithmetic by hand. Resolve `{renderMetadataStatsHelper}` from `{renderMetadataStatsProbeOrder}` (first existing path wins; HALT if neither resolves), then run it against the staged provenance-map and metadata.json:

```bash
uv run {renderMetadataStatsHelper} <staging-skill-dir>/provenance-map.json \
    --check <staging-skill-dir>/metadata.json
```

The helper re-bins `entries[]` by `signature_source`, recomputes `exports_documented`, `exports_total`, and `public_api_coverage` / `total_coverage` (null when the denominator is 0), and cross-checks `stats.scripts_count` / `stats.assets_count` against the `scripts[]` / `assets[]` array lengths and the provenance-map `file_entries` counts. It takes the judgment values (`exports_public_api`, `exports_internal`, `effective_denominator`) from `metadata.json` itself and infers the shape from `scope_type` / `skill_type` (pass `--shape` to override). Parse the emitted JSON (rely on the JSON, not the exit code):

- **`coherence.ok: true`** — the computed fields are internally consistent; record "Metadata: PASS".
- **`coherence.ok: false`** — each `violations[]` entry is `{field, expected, actual}` where `expected` is the correct value. **Auto-fix each computed-value violation** (`field` starting `stats.` or `confidence_distribution.`) by setting that field in `metadata.json` to `expected` (write via `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target <staging-skill-dir>/metadata.json`), leaving every other stats field — e.g. `stats.notes` on a reference app — untouched. Record "Metadata: auto-fixed {N} computed-value discrepanc(y|ies)" listing the fields. These are computed values, so the helper is authoritative — a `confidence_distribution` violation is the per-entry mis-binning compile.md §4 describes (T2 annotations + T3 doc items counted on top of the per-export tiers); the helper's per-entry counts replace them. Carve-outs are handled by `--shape`: a **stack** distribution sums to the constituent count and a **reference-app** distribution to the per-citation count, so those are consistent states, not violations. A `provenance.file_entries.*` violation is not a computed metadata field — it means the provenance-map `file_entries` and metadata counts disagree; record it as a warning for manual reconciliation rather than auto-editing the count.

Then verify the two fields the helper does not own (genuine constants/contract):
- `spec_version` is `"1.3"`.
- `scope_type` is present and equals the brief's `scope.type` verbatim.

### 8. Update Evidence Report

Add validation results to evidence-report content in context:

```markdown
## Validation Results
- Schema: {pass/fail} (quality score: {score}/100)
- Frontmatter: {pass/fail}
- Body: {pass/fail} {split-body applied if applicable}
- Security: {pass/warn/skipped}
- Content Quality (tessl): {pass/warn/skipped} (score: {score}%)
- Metadata: {pass/fail}

## Quality Score Breakdown
- Frontmatter (30%): {score} | Description (30%): {score} | Body (20%): {score} | Links (10%): {score} | File (10%): {score}

## Description Guard
- Restored: {true/false}
- Triggering tool: {tool_name or —}
- Original description preserved: {true/false}
- Notes: {one-sentence detail or —}

## Auto-Fixed Issues
- {list of issues automatically corrected by --fix}

## Remaining Warnings / Security Findings / Content Quality (tessl)
- {warnings, security results, tessl scores and suggestions — or "skipped"}
```

**Auto-Decisions table (reconcile from the durable sink — idempotent):** all gates have now fired — every one appended its row to the on-disk sink `{sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl` as it landed (including §6b's tessl-suggestions row), step 5 §7 rendered the step 1–3d rows into the staged `<staging-skill-dir>/evidence-report.md`, and steps 7–9 add none. Reconcile: read the sink's JSON lines (the authoritative durable record — it survives any compaction of the in-context buffer), union them with both the `## Auto-Decisions` rows already in `<staging-skill-dir>/evidence-report.md` and the in-context `headless_decisions[]` buffer, keyed on `step`+`gate` so no decision is duplicated or dropped, and re-render the section from that union. Because the rows are recovered from the sink rather than from the possibly-compacted buffer, the audit table stays complete on a long headless run. Emit one row per entry:

```
## Auto-Decisions

| Step | Gate | Decision | Rationale | Timestamp |
|------|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| {step} | {gate} | {decision}{value?} | {rationale} | {timestamp} |
```

If the sink, the on-disk rows, and `headless_decisions[]` are all empty, keep the single line step 5 §7 emitted: `No auto-decisions — workflow ran interactively (or all gates had no match to auto-resolve).` This keeps the section always present so reviewers can tell "zero auto-decisions" apart from "section missing", and keeps the row count equal to `summary.auto_decision_count`.

**Description Guard population:** if the §0 protocol fired during §2 (`skill-check --fix`) or §4 (`split-body`), fill the four Description Guard fields from context:

- `Restored: true` when `description_guard_restored == true`, otherwise `false`.
- `Triggering tool`: the tool name recorded by §0 (`skill-check --fix`, `skill-check split-body`, etc.), or `—` if the guard did not fire.
- `Original description preserved`: `true` if the restore succeeded (on-disk now matches the pre-tool snapshot), `false` if restoration itself failed (rare — treat as a halt condition in a future version).
- `Notes`: a one-sentence description of what the tool had changed. Typical values: `"replaced with generic summary"`, `"truncated at N chars"`, `"angle-bracket tokens re-introduced"`, `"field deleted entirely"`. If `Restored: false`, use `—`.

When `Restored: false`, the three follow-up fields are all `—` — this is the clean-run expected state.

### 9. Auto-Proceed

Conditional interaction: §6b halts for user input only when tessl produced novel suggestions; otherwise the step auto-proceeds. After validation completes (including any §6b decisions), load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it. Tool unavailability and validation failures are skips and warnings, never halts.
