# Step 1: Load Brief

## STEP GOAL:

To load and validate the skill-brief.yaml compilation config, resolve the source code location, and load the forge tier from sidecar to determine available capabilities for the compilation pipeline.

## Rules

- Focus only on loading brief, resolving source, and determining tier — do not begin extraction or compilation
- Do not write any output files — this step only loads and validates

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Load Forge Tier

Load `{forgeTierFile}` completely.

**If file does not exist:**
Halt with: "Forge halted: No forge configuration found. Run [SF] Setup Forge first to detect tools and set your tier."

**If file exists:**
Extract and report:
- `tier`: Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep
- `tools`: which tools are available (gh, ast-grep, ccc, qmd)
- `ccc_index`: ccc index state (status, indexed_path, last_indexed) — needed by step 2b

**Apply tier override:** Read `{preferencesFile}`. If `tier_override` is set and is one of the exact valid tier values (`Quick`, `Forge`, `Forge+`, `Deep`), use it instead of the detected tier. **If `tier_override` is set but is not one of those four values:** log a warning — "Unknown tier_override `{value}` in preferences.yaml; falling back to detected tier `{detected_tier}`. Valid values: Quick, Forge, Forge+, Deep." — and use the detected tier. Never silently apply an unknown override value, and never map it heuristically to a tier.

**Record the decision:** append an entry to the in-context `headless_decisions[]` buffer (initialize to `[]` at the start of this step if absent) whenever a non-interactive choice is made automatically — both the valid-override path AND the rejected-override path:

- Valid override applied: `{step: "load-brief", gate: "tier-override", decision: "apply", value: "{tier_override}", rationale: "explicit preferences.yaml tier_override", timestamp: {ISO}}`
- Invalid override rejected: `{step: "load-brief", gate: "tier-override", decision: "reject-invalid", value: "{tier_override}", fallback: "{detected_tier}", rationale: "tier_override not in {Quick,Forge,Forge+,Deep}", timestamp: {ISO}}`

These entries stay in the in-context buffer until §3 establishes the on-disk auto-decision sink and seeds it with the buffer-so-far; from then on every later gate's decision is appended to the sink as it lands (per the headless Workflow Rule). Step 5 §7 renders the sink into the evidence-report `## Auto-Decisions` table and step 6 §8 reconciles it, so reviewers can audit every silent choice even on a run long enough to compact the in-context buffer before step 5.

### 2. Discover Skill Brief

**If user provided a specific brief path or skill name:**
- If the value looks like a file path (starts with `/`, `./`, `~`, or contains path separators): treat it as a direct file path and load it
- Otherwise, treat it as a skill name and search `{forge_data_folder}/{skill-name}/skill-brief.yaml`
- If found, load it completely

**If user invoked with --batch flag:**
- Check `{sidecar_path}/batch-state.yaml` for an active batch checkpoint:
  - If `batch_active: true`: validate the checkpoint before trusting it — both conditions below must hold:
    1. `0 <= current_index < len(brief_list)` — the index points inside the recorded list.
    2. `os.path.exists(brief_list[current_index])` — the brief file is still on disk.
    If both hold, load the brief at `brief_list[current_index]` (resuming a batch loop from step 8). If **either** check fails, the checkpoint is stale (briefs renamed, moved, or deleted between runs; index off the end after a partial failure). Log a warning — "Stale batch checkpoint — current_index={i}, brief_list length={n}, brief_exists={bool}. Resetting and re-discovering." — then set `batch_active: false` in `batch-state.yaml` and fall through to the no-checkpoint branch below.
  - If no checkpoint exists or `batch_active` is false: search specified directory for all `skill-brief.yaml` files, list discovered briefs with skill names, store list for batch loop processing, and load the FIRST brief

**If no brief found:**
Halt with: "No skill brief found. Run [BS] Brief Skill to create one, or use [QS] Quick Skill for brief-less generation."

### 3. Validate Brief Structure

Run the deterministic schema validator — it checks required fields, regex patterns (`name`, `version`), enum membership (`source_type`, `source_authority`, `forge_tier`, `scope.type`), type correctness, the docs-only conditional rule (`doc_urls` ≥ 1 when `source_type == "docs-only"`), and the version-non-empty-or-whitespace rule:

```bash
uv run {validateBriefSchemaHelper} <path-to-skill-brief.yaml>
```

The helper emits:

```json
{
  "valid": <bool>,
  "errors":   [{"field": "...", "message": "Brief validation failed: ..."}, ...],
  "warnings": [{"field": "...", "message": "..."}, ...],
  "halt_reason": "brief-missing" | "brief-malformed" | "brief-invalid" | null,
  "brief": { ...parsed YAML when loadable... }
}
```

**If `valid` is false:** HALT and display the first error's `message` field verbatim — the helper already formats messages in the "Brief validation failed: ..." form the user expects. For halt-reasons:

- `brief-missing` — the brief path doesn't exist. Display the helper's message (it includes the `Run [BS] Brief Skill` redirect).
- `brief-malformed` — the YAML failed to parse. Display the helper's message.
- `brief-invalid` — schema or conditional-rule violation. Display the first `errors[].message`. Multiple errors may appear; the user typically fixes one source and re-runs.

**If `valid` is true:** continue with `brief` (the parsed object) for downstream sections. Surface any `warnings[]` to the user but do not halt.

**Establish the auto-decision sink (durable headless audit).** The brief is now confirmed, so create the on-disk audit sink at `{sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl` — one compact JSON object per line — and seed it with whatever is already in the in-context `headless_decisions[]` buffer (the §1 tier-override row, or nothing if none fired). This truncates any stale sink a prior brief left behind:

```bash
: > {sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl          # truncate / create empty
# then, for each entry already in headless_decisions[], append its compact JSON:
printf '%s\n' '{decision-json}' >> {sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl
```

From here on, **every time a later gate appends an auto-decision to `headless_decisions[]`, append that same object as a line to this sink the moment it lands** (the on-landing append the headless Workflow Rule mandates). The array is tiny, so the append costs nothing and keeps a complete on-disk copy across the token-heavy step 3→5 extraction window — the point where a long component-library run can compact the in-context buffer. Step 5 §7 renders this sink into the evidence-report `## Auto-Decisions` table and step 6 §8 reconciles it, so the audit table and `auto_decision_count` stay complete even when the buffer is lost.

**Field reference (for human readers):**

The complete contract — required fields, optional fields, types, and rules — lives in `src/shared/scripts/schemas/skill-brief.v1.json` and the prose mirror at `src/skf-brief-skill/assets/skill-brief-schema.md`. Read those if you need to explain a specific field; do not restate the rules here.

### 4. Resolve Source Code Location

**If `source_type: "docs-only"`:** Skip source resolution. Set `source_root: null` in context. Proceed directly to section 5 (Report Initialization) — docs-only skills have no source to resolve.

**If source_repo is a GitHub URL or owner/repo format:**
- Verify repository exists via `gh_bridge.list_tree(owner, repo, branch)` — **Tool resolution:** `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{branch}?recursive=1` or direct file listing if local; see `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`
- If branch not specified, detect default branch
- Store resolved: owner, repo, branch, file tree — note: `source_root` for remote repos is initially set to the remote URL (for detection and API access purposes) and then updated to the local workspace/clone path during step 3 source resolution
- **Version-to-tag pinning intent:** If `brief.target_version` is absent but `brief.version` is present, record the intent to apply **implicit tag resolution** from `brief.version` when step 3 resolves the source. Do not resolve the tag here — tag resolution runs in step 3 alongside the clone. This step only notes the pinning intent so step 3 knows to attempt it. See `references/source-resolution-protocols.md` → "Implicit Tag Resolution".

**If source_repo is a local path:**
- Verify path exists and contains source files
- Store resolved: local path as `source_root`, file listing

**If source cannot be resolved:**
Halt with: "Source not found: `{source_repo}`. Verify the repository exists and is accessible."

### 5. Report Initialization

Display initialization summary:

"**Forge initialized.**

**Skill:** {name} v{version}
**Source:** {source_repo} @ {branch}
**Language:** {language}
**Scope:** {scope}
**Tier:** {tier} — {tier_description}
**Tools:** {available_tools_list}

Proceeding to ecosystem check..."

Where tier_description follows positive capability framing:
- Quick: "Source reading and spec validation"
- Forge: "AST-backed structural extraction"
- Forge+: "Semantic-guided precision — ccc pre-ranks files before AST extraction"
- Deep: "Full intelligence — structural + contextual + QMD knowledge synthesis"

### 6. Auto-Proceed

No user interaction. After initialization completes and all data is loaded (including `target_version` if present), load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it. A failed prerequisite check above has already halted with an actionable error rather than reaching here.
