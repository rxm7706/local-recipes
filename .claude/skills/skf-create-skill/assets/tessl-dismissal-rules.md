# tessl Dismissal Rules

This file is the **single source of truth** for tessl review findings that Skill Forge expects and must dismiss. Step-06 §6 loads this file, parses the `tessl skill review` JSON output, and cross-references each finding against the rules below. Matches are dismissed with their rationale logged to the evidence report; non-matches surface to the user via §6b. Never embed dismissal logic in step files — update the rules here first and reference them from step 6.

## Score Thresholds

When parsing tessl output, check these fields against the thresholds below. Violations trigger warnings or errors as specified.

| Field | Threshold | Severity on violation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `review_score` (overall) | `>= 60` | warn | Two-tier SKF skills trade some conciseness score for progressive disclosure. 60 is the floor below which something is genuinely wrong. |
| `description_field` validator finding | none expected | **error — recover, then halt** | The **deterministic** `description_field` validator surfaces as a `findings[]` entry (not as the judge percentage). It parses the frontmatter `description` as a raw string and rejects angle-bracket / XML-tag content. step 5 §2a unconditionally replaces `<` with `{` and `>` with `}` before validation, so a `description_field` finding means the sanitizer was bypassed — a downstream tool rewrote the description. Attempt recovery per rule `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` (re-apply the §2a substitution in place on the staging SKILL.md frontmatter and re-run tessl). Halt only if recovery fails. |
| `description_score` (LLM judge %) | `>= 60` | warn | The judge's 0–100 discoverability score, composed of `trigger_term_quality`, `specificity`, `completeness`, and `distinctiveness` sub-scores. A value below 100 while the deterministic `description_field` validator PASSES is a soft discoverability hint (e.g. jargon density), **not** a sanitizer bypass — record a warning and continue. Never halt on the judge percentage alone; the authored brief is the source of truth for the description. |
| `content_score` | `>= 60` | warn | Two-tier design deliberately duplicates key API data across Tier 1 and Tier 2. Conciseness scorer penalizes this. 60 is the acceptable floor. |

**Recovery is gated on the deterministic validator, not the judge percentage.** If tessl emits a `findings[]` entry with rule ID `description_field` (angle-bracket / XML-tag rejection), **attempt recovery first** per rule `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` below: re-apply step 5 §2a's `<` → `{` / `>` → `}` substitution in place on the staging SKILL.md frontmatter `description`, then re-run `npx -y tessl skill review <staging-skill-dir>` once. If the re-run clears the `description_field` finding, log `description-recovery: applied ({count} substitutions)` in the evidence report and proceed to normal suggestion handling. If recovery fails, halt with: "Description sanitization recovery failed — step 5 §2a's `<`/`>` → `{`/`}` replacement did not resolve the tessl finding. Investigate the staging SKILL.md frontmatter for non-angle-bracket content that tessl is still rejecting, and patch §2a accordingly. Do not edit the description manually." Do not proceed to §6b user prompt on an unrecovered failure.

A `description_score` (LLM judge %) below 100 **without** an accompanying `description_field` finding is **not** a recovery trigger and **not** a halt condition: record `description_judge_score: {n}% (deterministic description_field validator PASSED)` as a warning in the evidence report and continue to suggestion handling. The recover-then-halt path is reserved for the deterministic validator.

## Suggestion Dismissal Rules

Each rule below describes a tessl suggestion that Skill Forge expects and dismisses automatically. For each `judge_suggestion` in tessl output, check it against these rules in order. If any rule matches, record the dismissal in the evidence report (`rule_id`, `rationale`) and do not apply the suggestion. If no rule matches, the suggestion is novel and must surface to the user in §6b.

### Rule: `remove-manual-markers`

- **Scorer:** any
- **Match criteria (any of):**
  - Suggestion text contains `[MANUAL]` AND one of: `remove`, `delete`, `strip`, `clean up`
  - Suggestion text contains `manual marker` AND one of: `remove`, `delete`, `unnecessary`
- **Rationale:** `<!-- [MANUAL] -->` markers delineate author-added content that `skf-update-skill` preserves during merge operations. Removing them would cause update-skill to overwrite author edits on the next run. The markers are a load-bearing contract between create-skill, test-skill, and update-skill.
- **Action:** dismiss.

### Rule: `move-full-api-reference`

- **Scorer:** any
- **Match criteria (all of):**
  - Suggestion text mentions `Full API Reference` OR a `## Full ...` section heading
  - Suggestion text contains one of: `move`, `relocate`, `extract`, `split out`, `separate file`, `external file`
- **Rationale:** The two-tier design (Tier 1 inline + Tier 2 inline) keeps Tier 2 sections inline by default. `skill-check split-body` relocates Tier 2 to `references/` only when the body exceeds size limits — see step 6 §4. Preemptive relocation destroys the standalone SKILL.md that the cited 100% task accuracy (vs. 79% for on-demand retrieval) depends on.
- **Action:** dismiss.

### Rule: `consolidate-duplicate-parameters`

- **Scorer:** `conciseness` or any
- **Match criteria (any of):**
  - Suggestion mentions `duplicate parameter`, `redundant parameter`, `consolidate parameter`
  - Suggestion mentions both `Key API` / `Key API Summary` AND `Full API Reference` and suggests merging them
- **Rationale:** Tier 1 Key API Summary intentionally lists only key parameters for standalone discoverability. Tier 2 Full API Reference provides complete parameter tables, types, defaults, and edge cases. This is progressive disclosure, not duplication. Consolidating would force agents to scroll to Tier 2 for the most common function calls, defeating Tier 1's purpose and breaking the split-body Tier 1 preservation contract in step 6 §4.
- **Action:** dismiss.

### Rule: `conciseness-redundancy-between-tiers`

- **Scorer:** `conciseness`
- **Match criteria (all of):**
  - Scorer is `conciseness`
  - Suggestion or score rationale references redundancy between Tier 1 and Tier 2 sections (typically `Key API` ↔ `Full API` or `Quick Start` ↔ `Full Reference`)
- **Expected score:** 2/3 is normal. 3/3 is only achievable by collapsing the two-tier design.
- **Rationale:** Progressive disclosure is the intentional SKF design. The conciseness scorer has no concept of Tier 1 / Tier 2 and flags the structure as redundancy. Collapsing the two tiers would eliminate standalone discoverability and break split-body behavior.
- **Action:** dismiss. Do not attempt to raise the score above 2/3.

### Rule: `provenance-citations-required`

- **Scorer:** `conciseness`, `actionability`, or any
- **Match criteria (any of):**
  - Suggestion text references `[SRC:`, `[AST:`, `[QMD:`, or `[EXT:` annotations AND one of: `remove`, `strip`, `omit`, `drop`
  - Suggestion mentions `provenance annotations`, `source citations`, or `source markers` AND one of: `remove`, `unnecessary`, `token bloat`, `token cost`
- **Expected score:** `conciseness` 1/3 is normal while inline provenance annotations are present. Raising it would require stripping the annotations.
- **Rationale:** SKF's zero-hallucination policy requires every claim in SKILL.md to carry a provenance citation — see the "Signature fidelity" rule in `assets/compile-assembly-rules.md` and the "Provenance Citation Format" table in `assets/skill-sections.md`. Removing them would break the provenance audit trail and the trust contract that lets `skf-update-skill` detect source drift and `skf-audit-skill` verify claims against source.
- **Action:** dismiss.

### Rule: `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream`

- **Scorer:** `description_field` (deterministic validator)
- **Match criteria (any of):**
  - Finding rule ID is `description_field` AND message mentions `XML tag`, `must not contain`, or angle-bracket-related text
- **Expected occurrence:** zero. step 5 §2a unconditionally replaces `<` with `{` and `>` with `}` in the frontmatter description before SKILL.md is written.
- **Action:** **Attempt recovery, then halt if recovery fails.** This is not a dismissal — the finding represents a real sanitizer bypass that step 6 must resolve before proceeding.
  1. **Re-apply §2a in place.** Read the current `description` from the on-disk staging SKILL.md frontmatter, replace every `<` with `{` and every `>` with `}`, and write the result back to the frontmatter. Re-sync the in-context copy to match. Count the substitutions; if zero, the description is already clean and the tessl finding points at something other than angle brackets — skip to the halt branch below.
  2. **Re-run tessl once.** Execute `npx -y tessl skill review <staging-skill-dir>` a second time and re-parse the JSON output.
  3. **On success** (the `description_field` finding is absent from the re-run): log `description-recovery: applied ({count} substitutions)` in the evidence report under "Dismissed tessl suggestions", then continue §6 with the recovered review result (proceed to normal suggestion handling against the rules below). The rerun's `judge_suggestions[]` replaces the original. A residual judge `description_score < 100` on the re-run is a warning, not a failure — recovery success is keyed on the deterministic finding clearing, not on the judge percentage reaching 100.
  4. **On failure** (the `description_field` finding persists after re-sanitization): halt with: "Description sanitization recovery failed — step 5 §2a's `<`/`>` → `{`/`}` replacement did not resolve the tessl finding. Investigate the staging SKILL.md frontmatter for non-angle-bracket content that tessl is still rejecting, and patch §2a accordingly. Do not edit the description manually."

The recovery path makes the skill shippable when a downstream tool (`skill-check --fix`, `split-body`, or a future validator) re-introduces angle brackets into the description after §2a has run. The Description Guard Protocol in step 6 §0 is the first line of defense against such rewrites; this rule is the second line, active when the guard also missed.

## How Step-06 §6 Uses This File

1. Load this file completely at the start of §6.
2. Run `npx -y tessl skill review <staging-skill-dir>` and parse JSON output.
3. Check score thresholds. For a deterministic `description_field` finding (angle-bracket / XML-tag rejection): follow the recovery-then-halt path described in the threshold table above and the `description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream` rule below — re-apply §2a in place, re-run tessl once, and continue on recovery success (finding cleared) or halt on recovery failure. A judge `description_score` below 100 while the `description_field` validator passes is a warning, not a halt. For other warns: continue, log warnings to evidence report.
4. For each `judge_suggestions[]` entry in the output:
   a. Iterate the rules above in order.
   b. If a rule's match criteria are satisfied, record `{rule_id, rationale, suggestion_text}` in the evidence report under "Dismissed tessl suggestions" and move to the next suggestion.
   c. If no rule matches, add the suggestion to the "Novel tessl suggestions" list that §6b surfaces to the user.
5. Proceed to §6b if any novel suggestions exist, or auto-proceed if all suggestions were dismissed.

## Evolving This List

When tessl changes or an SKF design decision shifts, add a new rule section above (`Rule:` / `Scorer:` / `Match criteria` / `Rationale` / `Action`), link each rationale to the concrete SKF design principle it protects (two-tier design, MANUAL markers, sanitization, split-body preservation — a rationale without such a link is a smell), and keep score thresholds at or above current production floors — never lower them to suppress real regressions.
