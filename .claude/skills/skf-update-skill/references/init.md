# Step 1: Initialize Update

## STEP GOAL:

Load the existing skill and all its provenance data, detect whether this is an individual or stack skill, load the forge tier configuration, and present a baseline summary so the user can confirm the update scope before proceeding.

## Rules

- Focus only on loading existing artifacts and establishing the baseline — read-only operations
- Do not begin change detection (Step 02)

## Steps

### 1. Request Skill Path

"**Which skill would you like to update?**

Provide either:
- A skill name (resolves via version-aware path resolution — see `knowledge/version-paths.md`)
- A full path to the skill folder
- A skill name with `--from-test-report` to use the test report's gap findings instead of source drift detection
- `--allow-workspace-drift` (gap-driven mode only) to intentionally bypass the step 3 §0.a guard that halts when the local workspace HEAD does not match `metadata.source_commit`. Only use this if you know the spot-checks should read the current workspace instead of the pinned tree — step 6 will NOT automatically re-pin
- `--allow-degraded` (headless mode only) to pre-authorize the lossy degraded full re-extraction if §4 finds no provenance map — without it, a headless run halts `blocked` there rather than silently rebuilding
- `--detect-only` to run detect-changes only and exit; emits the change manifest with no further work and no writes
- `--dry-run` to run detect-changes + re-extract and exit before merge/write; emits what WOULD change without modifying any artifact

**Skill:** {user provides path or name}"

**Version-Aware Path Resolution:**
1. Read `{skills_output_folder}/.export-manifest.json` and look up the skill name in `exports` to get `active_version`
2. If found: resolve to `{skill_package}` = `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/{active_version}/{skill-name}/`
3. If not in manifest: check for `active` symlink at `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/active` — resolve to `{skill_group}/active/{skill-name}/`
4. If neither: fall back to flat path `{skills_output_folder}/{skill-name}/`. If SKILL.md exists at the flat path, auto-migrate per `knowledge/version-paths.md` migration rules
5. Store the resolved path as `{resolved_skill_package}` for all subsequent artifact loading
6. Bind `{baseline_version}` to the pre-update version — for an update this is the version being updated, i.e. the `{active_version}` resolved in step 1 above (the flat-path fallback in step 4 has no version, so use the package version read from metadata.json in §2). Step 2 §1c passes `{baseline_version}` to `skf-provenance-gap-dispatch.py` as a required argument; leaving it unbound makes the helper search a wrong/empty directory and silently return `no-report`, dropping the major-version off-ramp.

Resolve the path to an absolute skill folder location.

**If `--from-test-report` was provided (or user references a test report):**

`skf-test-skill` writes timestamped test-report filenames (`test-report-{skill_name}-{ISO-TIMESTAMP}-{HASH}.md`) — there is no exact-name `test-report-{skill_name}.md` on disk. Locate the most recent report by glob, mirroring `skf-export-skill/references/load-skill.md §4b`:

1. Glob `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/{active_version}/test-report-{skill_name}-*.md` (i.e. `{forge_version}/test-report-{skill_name}-*.md`). Sort matches descending by the parsed ISO-timestamp segment in the filename (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` between the skill name and the hash — `sort -r` on the filename works because the timestamp is the first variable component). Take the first match.
2. If the versioned glob returns nothing, fall back to the same glob at the flat path `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/test-report-{skill_name}-*.md`. Pick the newest by parsed timestamp.
3. If neither glob returns anything, look for the stable companion `skf-test-skill-result-latest.json` in the same two directories (versioned first, then flat). Read the report path from `outputs[]` per the canonical contract documented at `shared/references/output-contract-schema.md` (resolved by skf-test-skill step 6 §4c) and load that file.

If a report is located, set `test_report_path` in context to the resolved absolute path and set `update_mode: gap-driven`. Surface the actual file picked in the message (e.g. `test-report-{skill_name}-20260507T050917Z-487606-9b2f.md`) so an operator can navigate to the report from the log. If all three lookups fail, warn and continue with normal source drift mode.

**If `--allow-workspace-drift` was provided:** set `allow_workspace_drift: true` in workflow context. This flag is consumed by step 3 §0.a's pre-flight drift guard (gap-driven mode only) and has no effect in normal source-drift mode.

**If `--allow-degraded` was provided:** set `allow_degraded: true` in workflow context. This flag is consumed by §4 below when no provenance map is found under `{headless_mode}`; it has no effect interactively (the [D]/[X] prompt is shown) or when a provenance map is present.

**If `--detect-only` was provided:** set `detect_only_mode: true` in workflow context. After step 2 (detect-changes) completes, jump directly to step 7 (report) — skip re-extract, merge, validate, and write. The report emits the change manifest and a `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` envelope with `status: "detect-only"`. **Compatibility:** `--detect-only` short-circuits before §0.a runs, so `--allow-workspace-drift` is silently ignored in detect-only mode (warn the user once at flag-parse time: "`--allow-workspace-drift` has no effect with `--detect-only` — workspace drift guard runs in step 3 §0.a, which is skipped").

**If `--dry-run` was provided:** set `dry_run_mode: true` in workflow context. After step 3 (re-extract) completes, jump directly to step 7 (report) — skip merge, validate, and write. The report emits what would change with `status: "dry-run"` in the envelope. No artifact on disk is modified — `--dry-run` is the "show me what an update would do without committing" mode.

**If BOTH `--detect-only` AND `--dry-run` were provided:** `--detect-only` wins (it's the more restrictive). Warn the user once: "`--detect-only` supersedes `--dry-run`; re-extract is skipped." Set `detect_only_mode: true`, ignore `dry_run_mode`.

### 1b. Concurrency Guard

**Skip this section entirely if `detect_only_mode` OR `dry_run_mode` is true.** Both inspection modes are read-only — they do not modify any artifact and are safe to run alongside a concurrent real update.

Two concurrent `skf-update-skill` runs against the same `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/` can corrupt provenance: one would write metadata.json mid-way through the other's extraction. The lock below catches the common accidental-double-invoke case (user re-runs in another shell before the first finishes). It is a **best-effort PID-file guard**, not a held flock — the LLM-driven workflow spans many turn boundaries and no single bash invocation can hold flock across them. Use the pattern from `skf-create-skill/references/source-resolution-protocols.md:87` (workspace concurrency guard) as the conceptual model.

**Mirror this exactly so the guard works the same way every run:**

```bash
# Lock file path — one per skill, lives next to skill-brief.yaml
LOCK={forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/.skf-update.lock
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$LOCK")"

if [ -f "$LOCK" ]; then
  HELD_PID=$(head -n1 "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ -n "$HELD_PID" ] && kill -0 "$HELD_PID" 2>/dev/null; then
    # Live PID — another update is running. HALT.
    echo "skf-update-skill: another update is in progress (pid=$HELD_PID, started $(awk 'NR==2' "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null))"
    # (LLM emits SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON status=halted-for-concurrent-run, see below)
    exit 1
  fi
  # Dead PID — lock left by a prior halted or crashed run; clear + overwrite
  echo "skf-update-skill: clearing lock from a prior halted/crashed run (pid=$HELD_PID)"
fi

# Acquire: write our PID + start timestamp (one per line)
printf '%s\n%s\n' "$$" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" > "$LOCK"
```

**Halt protocol on live-PID collision:**

- Display: `"**Another update is in progress.** The skill {skill_name} is locked by pid={HELD_PID} (started {timestamp from line 2 of the lock file}). Wait for that run to finish, or — if you know that pid is no longer running — delete {LOCK} manually and re-run."`
- In `{headless_mode}`, emit `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` with `status: "halted-for-concurrent-run"`, `error: {phase: "init:concurrency-guard", path: "{LOCK}", reason: "another update in progress (pid={HELD_PID})"}`, and exit immediately. **No `headless_decisions[]` entry** — this is a hard halt before any gate fires.

**Release contract:**

- The terminal health-check step (step 8) deletes the lock as its final action — the normal end of every non-inspection run. The two init-stage headless halts below (§4 no-provenance-map, §6 invalid-source-path) also delete it explicitly, since they fire right after acquisition, before the terminal step runs.
- Mid-workflow halts (detect-changes, re-extract, merge, write) do **not** delete the lock themselves — they rely on the self-heal below. This is deliberate: several of those halt sites are also reachable under `--detect-only`/`--dry-run`, which never acquired this lock, so a blind `rm -f` there could clobber a concurrent real update's lock.
- The lock is best-effort and self-healing: whatever a halt or crash (process kill, host reboot) leaves behind is cleared by the next run's live-PID check above, since the stored PID is a short-lived bash PID that is already dead. No manual cleanup needed in the common case.

### 2. Validate Required Artifacts

**Check SKILL.md exists:**
- Load `{resolved_skill_package}/SKILL.md`
- If missing: **ABORT** — "No SKILL.md found at `{resolved_skill_package}`. Run create-skill first."

**Check metadata.json exists:**
- Load `{resolved_skill_package}/metadata.json`
- Extract: `name`, `skill_type` (single or stack), `version`, `generation_date`, `confidence_tier`, `source_root`
- If missing: **ABORT** — "No metadata.json found. This skill may have been created manually. Run create-skill to generate provenance data."

**Detect skill type from metadata:**
- If `skill_type == "single"` or absent: flag as single skill
- If `skill_type == "stack"`: flag as stack skill — the guard below redirects it

### Stack Skill Guard

After loading metadata.json, check `skill_type`:
- If `skill_type` is `"stack"`: display message:
  "**Stack skills cannot be surgically updated.** Stack skills compose exports from multiple sources — surgical re-extraction requires re-running the full composition pipeline.
  
  **To update this stack skill**, run `skf-create-stack-skill` with the same project path. It will re-analyze manifests (code-mode) or re-read constituent skills (compose-mode) and produce an updated stack.
  
  If you came here from an audit report, the drift report identifies which constituent libraries changed — use that to decide whether re-composition is needed."
- Exit the workflow (do not proceed to step 2)

**This guard is the single gate for stack skills** — every stack is redirected to `skf-create-stack-skill` here, before step 2, and no flag (`--detect-only`, `--dry-run`, `--from-test-report`, `--allow-workspace-drift`) bypasses it. Every later stage therefore runs against a single skill only and carries no stack-merge branch.

### 3. Load Forge Tier Configuration

**Load `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`:**
- Extract: `tier` (Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep), available tools
- If missing: **ABORT** — "No forge-tier.yaml found. Run setup first to detect available tools."

**Apply tier override:** Read `{sidecar_path}/preferences.yaml`. If `tier_override` is set and is a valid tier value (Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep), use it instead of the detected tier.

**Determine analysis capabilities:**
- **Quick:** text pattern matching only → T1-low confidence
- **Forge:** AST structural extraction → T1 confidence
- **Forge+:** AST structural extraction + CCC semantic ranking → T1 confidence (with ccc signals)
- **Deep:** AST + QMD semantic enrichment → T1 + T2 confidence

### 4. Load Provenance Map

**Load `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/{active_version}/provenance-map.json`** (i.e., `{forge_version}/provenance-map.json`). If not found at the versioned path, fall back to `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/provenance-map.json`:
- Extract: export list, file mappings, extraction timestamps, confidence tiers
- Calculate provenance age (days since last extraction)

**If provenance map missing at both paths:**

"**WARNING:** No provenance map found at `{forge_version}/provenance-map.json` or flat fallback.

Without a provenance map, update-skill cannot perform targeted change detection. Options:

**[D]egraded mode** — Perform full re-extraction with T1-low confidence (equivalent to re-running create-skill but preserving [MANUAL] sections)
**[X]** — Abort and run create-skill first to generate provenance data

Select: [D] Degraded / [X] Abort"

- If D: set `degraded_mode = true`, proceed with full extraction scope
- If X: **ABORT**

**In `{headless_mode}` without `--allow-degraded` (default):** do not auto-select [D]. Degraded mode is a full, lossy T1-low re-extraction — choosing it unattended would silently swap surgical update for a create-skill-equivalent rebuild, a policy call that belongs to an operator. Halt instead: release the lock (`rm -f "$LOCK"`), emit `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` with `status: "blocked"`, `error: {phase: "init:load-provenance-map", path: "{forge_version}/provenance-map.json", reason: "no provenance map at versioned or flat path; degraded full re-extraction needs a human decision"}`, and exit. No `headless_decisions[]` entry — this is a hard halt, not an auto-resolved gate.

**In `{headless_mode}` with `--allow-degraded` (`allow_degraded: true`):** the operator pre-authorized the lossy rebuild for this run, so treat it as an auto-resolved [D] rather than a halt. Set `degraded_mode = true`, proceed with full extraction scope, and append to in-context `headless_decisions[]`: `{gate: "init.degraded-rebuild", default_action: "X", taken_action: "D", reason: "headless: --allow-degraded pre-authorized degraded full re-extraction", evidence: "no provenance map at {forge_version}/provenance-map.json or flat fallback"}`. Continue to step 2.

### 5. Load [MANUAL] Section Inventory

Load {manualSectionRulesFile} to understand [MANUAL] detection patterns (the human-readable rules for markers, parent-section mapping, and orphan/nesting handling).

**Capture the [MANUAL] inventory deterministically.** The workflow's headline rule is "[MANUAL] sections survive regeneration with zero content loss" — the pre-write inventory captured here is the exact baseline that write.md §1 and validate.md Check B verify against, so it must be a per-block byte-exact hash, not an eyeballed marker count. Run the `manual-inventory` subcommand of `{hashContentHelper}` and persist its JSON:

```bash
uv run {hashContentHelper} manual-inventory {resolved_skill_package}/SKILL.md \
    > {forge_version}/.manual-inventory.json
```

The emitted JSON is `{"blocks":[{name, content_hash, byte_offset, parent_heading}...], "count":N}` — each `content_hash` covers the block's byte-exact interior, so a later interior truncation that leaves the marker count unchanged is still caught. Bind the persisted path as `{manual_inventory}` in context; write.md §1 and validate.md Check B pass it to `manual-verify`. Surface the block `count` in the baseline summary (§7 `{manual_count}`).

### 6. Resolve Source Code Path

**From provenance map (if available):**
- Extract `source_root` path
- Validate source path exists and is accessible

**If source path invalid or missing:**

"**Source path from provenance map is invalid:** `{source_root}`

Provide the current source code path:
**Path:** {user provides path}"

**In `{headless_mode}`:** there is no operator to supply a path. Halt: release the lock (`rm -f "$LOCK"`), emit `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` with `status: "blocked"`, `error: {phase: "init:resolve-source-path", path: "{source_root}", reason: "source_root from provenance map is invalid or inaccessible and no interactive path can be supplied"}`, and exit. No `headless_decisions[]` entry — this is a hard halt, not an auto-resolved gate.

### 7. Present Baseline Summary

"**Update Skill Baseline:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Skill** | {skill_name} |
| **Type** | single |
| **Version** | {version} |
| **Created** | {created date} |
| **Source** | {source_root} |
| **Forge Tier** | {forge_tier} (current) vs {original_tier} (at creation) |
| **Provenance Age** | {days} days since last extraction |
| **Exports** | {export_count} tracked exports |
| **[MANUAL] Sections** | {manual_count} preserved sections |
| **Mode** | {normal/degraded/gap-driven} |

**Analysis plan:** {tier_description}
- {Quick: text pattern diff → T1-low findings}
- {Forge: AST structural diff → T1 findings}
- {Deep: AST structural + QMD semantic diff → T1 + T2 findings}

**Ready to detect changes and update this skill?**"

### 8. Confirmation Gate

Present "**Select:** [C] Continue to Change Detection" and wait for the user to confirm; on [C], load, read the full file, then execute {nextStepFile}.

**Headless (`{headless_mode}` true):** auto-continue and append to in-context `headless_decisions[]` (step 7 surfaces it in `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON`): `{gate: "init.update-confirmation", default_action: "C", taken_action: "C", reason: "headless: no user to prompt"}`. Entry shape: `src/shared/scripts/schemas/skf-update-result-envelope.v1.json`.
