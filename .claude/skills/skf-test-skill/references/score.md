# Step 5: Score

## STEP GOAL:

Calculate the overall completeness score by aggregating coverage, coherence, and external validation category scores with the appropriate weight distribution (naive or contextual), apply the pass/fail threshold, and determine the test result.

### 1. Load Scoring Rules

Load `{scoringRulesFile}` to get:
- Category weights (naive vs contextual distribution)
- Tier-dependent scoring adjustments

**Resolve the pass threshold (precedence: CLI > pipeline default > scalar > bundled fallback):**

1. If the workflow received `--threshold=<N>` on invocation, use that integer as `effective_threshold` (CLI wins). Set `threshold_source` = `"CLI override ({N}%)"`.
2. Else if `{pipeline_default_threshold}` is set in workflow context (resolved by init.md §1b from the per-pipeline threshold lookup table when `{pipeline_alias}` is present), use it as `effective_threshold`. Set `threshold_source` = `"pipeline default ({pipeline_alias} → {N}%)"`.
3. Else if the resolved `{defaultThreshold}` workflow-context variable (from SKILL.md On Activation §3 — `workflow.default_threshold` scalar, default `80`) is set, use it as `effective_threshold`. Set `threshold_source` = `"workflow default ({N}%)"`.
4. Else fall back to `80` (the bundled default — this branch should be unreachable when SKILL.md resolution ran correctly, but keeps the step robust if customize.toml resolution failed silently). Set `threshold_source` = `"bundled fallback (80%)"`.

Store `threshold_source` in workflow context for use in the score report section.

Pass `effective_threshold` into the scoring-input JSON's `threshold` field in §3a (the compute-score.py script already honors this field). The CLI flag, pipeline default, and the scalar all feed the same downstream field; the script does not need to know which layer supplied the value.

**Docs-only mode check:** If the Coverage Analysis section in `{outputFile}` notes docs-only mode (set by step 3 for skills with all `[EXT:...]` citations and no local source), apply Quick-tier weight redistribution: Signature Accuracy and Type Coverage are not scored, their weights (22% + 14%) are redistributed proportionally to remaining active categories. Coverage score is based on documentation completeness rather than source coverage (as calculated by step 3).

### 2. Read Category Scores from Output

Read `{outputFile}` and extract the category scores calculated in previous steps:

**From Coverage Analysis (step 03):**
- Export Coverage: {percentage}%
- Signature Accuracy: {percentage}% or N/A (Quick tier)
- Type Coverage: {percentage}% or N/A (Quick tier)

**From Coherence Analysis (step 04):**
- Combined Coherence: {percentage}% (contextual mode only)
- Or: not scored (naive mode — weight redistributed)

**From External Validation (step 04b):**
- External Validation Score: {percentage}% (combined skill-check + tessl average)
- Or: N/A (if neither tool was available — weight redistributed to other categories)

### 3. Apply Weight Distribution

**Read testMode from {outputFile} frontmatter.**

#### 2b. Apply State 2 Undercount Deduction (pre-script)

If `analysis_confidence == 'provenance-map'` (State 2) AND `metadata.json.skill_type != "stack"` AND step 3 recorded a provenance vs metadata divergence > 5% (see §4b in step 3), apply a 10-point deduction to `exportCoverage` BEFORE building the scoring input:

```
exportCoverage_adjusted = max(0, exportCoverage - 10)
```

Record in the report: `scoring_notes: State 2 undercount risk acknowledged — 10% deduction applied to Export Coverage (raw: {N}%, adjusted: {M}%)`. Use the adjusted value as the `exportCoverage` field in §3a below. The deduction is deterministic and does not change category weights or active-category counting.

Stack skills are exempt (the `metadata.json.skill_type != "stack"` guard above; `skill_type` is loaded in step 01 and also surfaces as `stackSkill` in §3a): a stack's own barrel is empty by design, so a provenance-vs-metadata divergence on a stack reflects the barrel-vs-constituent surface difference (suppressed by §4b's stack-skill branch in step 3), not extraction undercount — deducting for it would penalize a correctly built stack.

#### 3a. Construct Scoring Input JSON

Build a JSON object from the data gathered in steps 1-2:

```json
{
  "mode": "{testMode: contextual or naive}",
  "tier": "{forge_tier: Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep}",
  "docsOnly": "{true if docs_only_mode detected in step 03, else false}",
  "state2": "{true if analysis_confidence is provenance-map, else false}",
  "stackSkill": "{true if metadata.json.skill_type == 'stack', else false}",
  "referenceApp": "{true if metadata.json.scope_type == 'reference-app', else false}",
  "scores": {
    "exportCoverage": "{export_coverage_percentage}",
    "signatureAccuracy": "{signature_accuracy_percentage or null if N/A}",
    "typeCoverage": "{type_coverage_percentage or null if N/A}",
    "coherence": "{combined_coherence_percentage or null if naive mode}",
    "externalValidation": "{external_validation_score or null if N/A}"
  },
  "threshold": "{effective_threshold from §1 — CLI --threshold wins, then pipeline default, then workflow.default_threshold scalar, then 80}",
  "analysisConfidence": "{resolved analysis confidence — 'degraded' when python3/frontmatter validator missing; else full/provenance-map/metadata-only/remote-only/docs-only; omit if unknown}",
  "toolingStatus": "{a missing-helper marker like 'python3-missing' or 'frontmatter-validator-missing' when a helper is unavailable, else omit}"
}
```

**Important:** Score values must be numbers (not strings). Use `null` (not `"N/A"`) for categories that were not scored. `analysisConfidence` and `toolingStatus` are optional strings — pass them so the script can apply the post-score tooling cap (§3d) deterministically; the script fires Cap 1 when `analysisConfidence == "degraded"` or `toolingStatus` contains `missing`. Read `metadata.json.skill_type` from `{resolved_skill_package}/metadata.json`; if the value is `"stack"`, set `stackSkill: true` and pass `null` for `signatureAccuracy` and `typeCoverage` (the categories will be redistributed per `{scoringRulesFile}` Stack Skills rule). Likewise read `metadata.json.scope_type`; if the value is `"reference-app"`, set `referenceApp: true` and pass `null` for `signatureAccuracy` and `typeCoverage` (redistributed per `{scoringRulesFile}` Reference-App rule — a reference app documents wiring patterns, not library export signatures).

#### 3b. Run the Scoring Script

```bash
echo '<JSON>' | uv run {scoringScript} --stdin
```

Where `{scoringScript}` is the path resolved from the frontmatter variable (relative to the skill root, i.e., the skf-test-skill/ directory). The script also accepts the JSON as a positional argument (`uv run {scoringScript} '<JSON>'`) or via `--json-input '<JSON>'`; `--stdin` is preferred since it avoids shell-quote escaping of nested JSON.

Parse the JSON output. The script returns:
- `weights` — final redistributed weights per category
- `weightedScores` — weighted contribution per category
- `totalScore` — the overall completeness score
- `threshold` — the threshold used
- `result` — `"PASS"`, `"FAIL"`, or **`"INCONCLUSIVE"`** (minimum-evidence floor — see `{scoringRulesFile}`)
- `activeCategories` — list of categories that were scored
- `skippedCategories` — list of categories that were skipped
- `skipReasons` — why each category was skipped
- `weightSum` — sum of final weights (should be ~100)
- `inconclusiveReasons` — only present when `result == "INCONCLUSIVE"`; explains which floor clause tripped
- **Verdict-override group** — present as an atomic set of four keys only when a post-score cap or the threshold fallback engaged (§3d/§4b are applied by the script, not re-derived here):
  - `effectiveResult` — the **final verdict** after caps + fallback (`"PASS"` / `"FAIL"`); read this as the outcome for §4–§8
  - `capReason` — string describing the cap(s) that fired, or `null`
  - `thresholdFallback` — `true` when the FAIL→PASS-at-80-floor fallback fired
  - `originalThreshold` — the pre-fallback threshold when `thresholdFallback` is `true`, else `null`
  - When the group is **absent**, no cap or fallback engaged and `result` is the final verdict.

Use these values for Section 4 (pass/fail/inconclusive) and Section 6 (output formatting). **The script owns the minimum-evidence floor, both post-score caps, and the threshold fallback — everywhere below, read its emitted fields (`result`, `effectiveResult`, `capReason`, `thresholdFallback`) and never recompute a verdict, cap, or threshold decision.** The final verdict is `effectiveResult` when the override group is present, otherwise `result` (INCONCLUSIVE is never overridden).

#### 3c. Fallback (if script execution fails)

If the script is unavailable or errors, redistribute each skipped category's weight (the `null`-scored categories in the §3a JSON — naive mode already zeroes coherence, and Quick-tier/docsOnly/state2/stackSkill/referenceApp already null out Signature Accuracy + Type Coverage) proportionally across the active categories, then report `total = Σ(weight/100 × category_score)` using the detected mode's weight table in `{scoringRulesFile}`. Report: "**Note:** Scoring script unavailable — calculated manually per scoring-rules.md."

### 3d. Read Post-Score Caps (applied by the script)

The script applies two post-score caps — **Cap 1** (tooling degraded) and **Cap 2** (docs-only with no external validators) — and returns the settled outcome as `capReason` + `effectiveResult` (§3b). Read those fields; never recompute a cap. If `capReason` is non-null, record `scoring_notes: {capReason}` in the report. A fired cap forces the script's `PASS` into `FAIL`, never touches an INCONCLUSIVE verdict, and may still be re-flipped to PASS by the threshold fallback (§4b) — `effectiveResult` reflects that settled outcome. (Both caps exist because a degraded-tooling or docs-only-without-validators run has too thin an evidence base to trust a PASS; §3a passes the fields Cap 1 reads.)

### 4. Determine Result (PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE)

The scoring script enforces the minimum-evidence floor BEFORE comparing score vs threshold, then applies the post-score caps (§3d) and threshold fallback (§4b). The **settled verdict** is `effectiveResult` when the override group is present, otherwise `result`:

```
IF result == "INCONCLUSIVE" — minimum-evidence floor tripped; not PASS, not FAIL (never overridden)
ELSE settled verdict = effectiveResult if the override group is present, else result   (PASS or FAIL)
```

**INCONCLUSIVE floor clauses** (see `{scoringRulesFile}`):
- `active_categories < 2` (after all redistribution), OR
- `tier == "Quick"` AND Export Coverage is the sole scoring contributor

### 4b. Threshold Fallback and Evidence Report

After §4 determines the result but before §5 recommends the next workflow, the script's threshold fallback may already have converted a FAIL into a PASS at the 80% floor. This step documents that quality compromise in an evidence report.

The rule the script encodes (documented for interpretation): when `result == "FAIL"` AND `totalScore >= 80` AND `effective_threshold > 80`, the script overrides `result` to `"PASS"` at the 80% floor; an `INCONCLUSIVE` verdict is never overridden. Read the script's fields:

- `thresholdFallback == true` → the fallback fired; `effectiveResult` is `"PASS"` and `originalThreshold` holds the pre-fallback threshold.
- `thresholdFallback` absent or `false` → no fallback; the settled verdict from §4 stands.

**When `thresholdFallback` is true:**

1. Record `threshold_fallback: true`, `original_threshold: {originalThreshold}`, `fallback_threshold: 80` in workflow context.
2. Use `effectiveResult` (`"PASS"`) as the settled verdict — do not recompute it.
3. Set `effective_threshold = 80` for use by §5/§6/§7/§8.
4. Generate the evidence report (§4b.1 below).

The cap↔fallback interaction (a cap forcing FAIL that the fallback then re-flips to PASS at the 80 floor) is resolved inside the script — `effectiveResult` reflects the settled outcome. The `{totalScore}` used in the report below is the script's raw `totalScore`.

#### 4b.1 Generate Evidence Report

Write the evidence report to `{forge_version}/evidence-report-fallback.md`. The report documents the quality compromise for audit purposes.

**Read gap entries:** extract findings from the Coverage Analysis and Coherence Analysis sections in `{outputFile}` — list each gap with severity (Critical through Low).

**Check for prior remediation:** glob `{forge_version}/test-report-{skill_name}-*.md` for a prior test report. If found, note the path — this implies remediation was attempted between runs. If not found, note "first test run — no prior remediation cycle".

**Check for post-score cap:** if Cap 1 or Cap 2 (§3d) fired, note the cap reason in the remediation section: "Score capped due to {cap_reason} — address tooling to test at the higher threshold."

**Evidence report template:**

```markdown
# Evidence Report: Threshold Fallback

**Skill:** {skill_name}
**Date:** {ISO-8601 timestamp}
**Run ID:** {run_id}

## Threshold Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Attempted Threshold | {original_threshold}% |
| Achieved Score | {totalScore}% |
| Threshold Source | {threshold_source} |
| Final Accepted Threshold | 80% |

## Findings Preventing Higher Threshold

{For each gap entry from Coverage Analysis and Coherence Analysis:}
- **{GAP-NNN}: {title}** — Severity: {severity}, Category: {category}

{Count: N critical, M high, P medium, Q low, R info findings}

## Remediation Context

{If prior test report exists:}
A prior test run was found at `{prior_report_path}`, indicating remediation was attempted between runs.

{If no prior test report:}
No prior test report found for this skill version — this is the first test run.

{If post-score cap was active:}
**Note:** Score was capped due to {cap_reason}. Address tooling limitations to test at the higher threshold.

## Conclusion

Skill accepted at 80% floor (original target: {original_threshold}%). The {N} findings above prevented meeting the higher threshold. Review and address findings before the next pipeline run to achieve the {original_threshold}% target.
```

Record `evidence_report_path: '{forge_version}/evidence-report-fallback.md'` in workflow context for use by §6/§7/§8 and by report.md.

### 5. Determine Next Workflow Recommendation

Based on the **settled verdict** (§4 — `effectiveResult` when the override group is present, else `result`; INCONCLUSIVE is never overridden):

**IF PASS:**
- `nextWorkflow: 'export-skill'` — skill is ready for export
- **Drift override:** if workflow context carries
  `allow_workspace_drift: true` (set in step 1 §5b when the user passed
  `--allow-workspace-drift` AND the workspace HEAD did not match
  `metadata.source_commit`), the PASS is a **conditional PASS**:
  - Write `testResult: 'pass-with-drift'` to the output frontmatter instead of
    bare `'pass'`. The result contract (§4c of step 6) mirrors the same
    value.
  - Override `nextWorkflow` to `'update-skill'` — **refuse to recommend
    `export-skill`**. The drift override weakens the workflow's strongest
    false-positive guard (we tested against HEAD, not the pinned source); a
    PASS under drift is not trustworthy enough to promote to export without a
    clean re-test against the pinned commit.
  - Record `scoring_notes: workspace drift overridden — PASS is conditional; re-run against pinned commit before export`.

**IF FAIL:**
- `nextWorkflow: 'update-skill'` — skill needs remediation before export

**IF INCONCLUSIVE:**
- `nextWorkflow: 'manual-review'` — evidence base is insufficient to grade the skill automatically. The test report records `inconclusiveReasons` from the scoring script. Surface to the user — do not auto-recommend export or update.

### 6. Append Completeness Score to Output

Append the **Completeness Score** section to `{outputFile}`:

```markdown
## Completeness Score

### Score Breakdown

| Category | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Export Coverage | {N}% | {W}% | {WS}% |
| Signature Accuracy | {N}% | {W}% | {WS}% |
| Type Coverage | {N}% | {W}% | {WS}% |
| Coherence | {N}% | {W}% | {WS}% |
| External Validation | {N}% | {W}% | {WS}% |
| **Total** | | **100%** | **{total}%** |

### Result

**Score:** {total}%
**Threshold:** {threshold}%
**Result:** **{PASS|FAIL|INCONCLUSIVE}**
{If INCONCLUSIVE:}
**Inconclusive Reasons:**
{bulleted list from script `inconclusiveReasons`}

**Threshold Source:** {threshold_source}
{If threshold_fallback is true:}
**Threshold Fallback:** scored {totalScore}% against {original_threshold}% target — accepted at 80% floor. Evidence report: {evidence_report_path}
**Weight Distribution:** {naive (redistributed) | contextual (full)}
**Tier Adjustment:** {none | Quick tier — signature and type coverage not scored}
**External Validators:** {both available | skill-check only | tessl only | none — weight redistributed}
**Analysis Confidence:** {full | provenance-map | metadata-only | remote-only | docs-only}
```

If `analysis_confidence` is not `full`, append a degradation notice. **The notice must be confidence-aware** — see the degradation notice rules in `{sourceAccessProtocol}`:

```markdown
### Access Degradation Notice

**Resolved via:** {analysis_confidence} {confidence breakdown if provenance-map, e.g., "(T1 AST-verified at compilation time)" or "(12 T1, 3 T1-low)"}
**Impact:** {describe limitation — e.g., "Signature checks limited to name-matching. Source file:line citations from provenance-map, not live AST." — or "Provenance data is at highest confidence; no limitation." for all-T1 provenance-map}
**Recommendation:** {confidence-dependent — see {sourceAccessProtocol} degradation notice rules. Do not recommend local clone when provenance-map entries are already T1.}
```

### 7. Update Output Frontmatter

Update `{outputFile}` frontmatter:
- `testResult: '{pass|pass-with-drift|fail|inconclusive}'` (lowercase; mirrors the **settled verdict** — `effectiveResult` when the override group is present, else `result` — with `pass-with-drift` substituted for `pass` when `allow_workspace_drift` was set and drift was observed — see §5 drift override)
- `score: '{total}%'`
- `threshold: '{threshold}%'`
- `thresholdSource: '{threshold_source}'`
- When `threshold_fallback` is true, add: `thresholdFallback: true`, `originalThreshold: '{original_threshold}%'`, `evidenceReportPath: '{evidence_report_path}'`
- `analysisConfidence: '{full|degraded|provenance-map|metadata-only|remote-only|docs-only}'`
- `nextWorkflow: '{export-skill|update-skill|manual-review}'`
- Append `'score'` to `stepsCompleted`

### 8. Report Score

Report the completeness score to the user: the total percentage and PASS/FAIL verdict, the per-category weighted breakdown (already appended to the report in §6), the threshold, and the recommended next workflow (export-skill on pass, update-skill on fail). When `threshold_fallback` is true, include the fallback notice:

**Threshold fallback:** scored {totalScore}% against {original_threshold}% target — accepted at 80% floor. Evidence report: {evidence_report_path}

Then proceed to the gap report.

Update stepsCompleted, then load and execute {nextStepFile}.
