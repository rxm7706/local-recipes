# Step 1: Initialize Test

## STEP GOAL:

Discover and validate the target skill, load forge tier state to determine analysis depth, and create the test report document from template.

### 1. Receive Skill Path

If skill path was provided as workflow argument, use it directly.

**Recognized flags on the invocation:**
- `--allow-workspace-drift` — bypass the section 5b pre-flight guard that halts when local workspace HEAD does not match `metadata.source_commit`. Store `allow_workspace_drift: true` in workflow context when present. No effect when `source_commit` is unpinned or the source is not a git working tree.
- `--no-discovery` — skip the §4b Discovery Testing block in step 6 (report). Store `no_discovery: true` in workflow context when present.
- `--no-health-check` — skip the §7 health-check dispatch in step 6 (report). Store `no_health_check: true` in workflow context when present.
- `--tier=<Quick|Forge|Forge+|Deep>` — bypass the §4 forge-tier.yaml sidecar HALT. Store `tier_flag: '<value>'` in workflow context when present; §4 will set `detected_tier` directly from this value and skip the sidecar probe.
- `--threshold=<N>` — override the pass threshold for this run. Consumed by `references/score.md` §1; CLI wins over per-pipeline defaults (§1b) and the `workflow.default_threshold` scalar.

If no path provided, ask:

"**Which skill would you like to test?**

Provide the skill path or name. I'll search in `{skillsOutputFolder}`.

**Path or name:**"

### 1b. Resolve Per-Pipeline Quality Threshold

If `{pipeline_alias}` is set in the workflow data context (forwarded by the forger when TS runs inside a pipeline — see `shared/references/pipeline-contracts.md` Pipeline State), look up the alias in the per-pipeline threshold defaults table:

| Pipeline Alias | Default Threshold |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `forge-auto`   | 90                |
| `forge`        | 80                |
| `forge-quick`  | 80                |
| `campaign`     | 90                |

- **If `{pipeline_alias}` is present AND found in the table:** store the corresponding value as `{pipeline_default_threshold}` in workflow context. This variable is consumed by `references/score.md` §1 as a precedence layer between CLI `--threshold` and `{defaultThreshold}`.
- **If `{pipeline_alias}` is present but NOT in the table:** `{pipeline_default_threshold}` remains unset. Score.md falls through to `{defaultThreshold}`.
- **If `{pipeline_alias}` is absent** (standalone TS invocation, not running inside a pipeline): `{pipeline_default_threshold}` remains unset. Score.md falls through to `{defaultThreshold}`.

### 2. Validate Skill Exists (version-aware)

Resolve the skill path using version-aware resolution (see `{versionPathsKnowledge}`):

1. Read `{skillsOutputFolder}/.export-manifest.json` and look up the skill name in `exports` to get `active_version`
2. **Manifest-lag guard.** If the skill is in the manifest, also read the `active` symlink target at `{skillsOutputFolder}/{skill_name}/active`. If that symlink resolves to a *different* version than `active_version`, prefer the **symlink target** as `{resolved_version}` and emit an Info note: "manifest active_version {M} lags the active symlink {N} — testing the symlink target (the just-forged version); run export-skill to reconcile the manifest." This is the canonical SS→TS→EX case: create-stack-skill flipped `active` to the new version, but the manifest only advances when export-skill runs — so a bare manifest-first resolution would test the *previously exported* version and report a PASS for the wrong version (silent false confidence). When the symlink matches `active_version` (or no `active` symlink exists), use `active_version`. See `{versionPathsKnowledge}` "Reading Workflows".
3. If found: resolve to `{skill_package}` = `{skillsOutputFolder}/{skill_name}/{resolved_version}/{skill_name}/`
4. If not in manifest: check for `active` symlink at `{skillsOutputFolder}/{skill_name}/active` — resolve to `{skill_group}/active/{skill_name}/`
5. If neither: fall back to flat path `{skillsOutputFolder}/{skill_name}/`. If SKILL.md exists at the flat path, auto-migrate per `{versionPathsKnowledge}` migration rules
6. Store the resolved path as `{resolved_skill_package}`

Check that the skill package contains required files:

**Required files:**
- `{resolved_skill_package}/SKILL.md` — the skill documentation
- `{resolved_skill_package}/metadata.json` — skill metadata

**If SKILL.md missing:**
"**Error: SKILL.md not found at `{resolved_skill_package}/SKILL.md`**

This skill has not been created yet. Run the **create-skill** workflow first."

**Headless envelope (if `{headless_mode}`):** emit to **stderr**:

```
SKF_TEST_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_name":"{skill_name}","verdict":null,"score":null,"threshold":null,"report_path":null,"next_workflow":null,"exit_code":1,"halt_reason":"target-inaccessible"}
```

HALT — do not proceed.

**If metadata.json missing:**
"**Warning:** metadata.json not found. Proceeding with limited metadata. Some checks may be skipped."

### 3. Validate Frontmatter Compliance

**3a. Resolve `{frontmatterScript}` deterministically.** Probe each candidate path in `{frontmatterScriptProbeOrder}` (in order) against the filesystem:

1. `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/shared/scripts/skf-validate-frontmatter.py` (installed module layout)
2. `{project-root}/src/shared/scripts/skf-validate-frontmatter.py` (development-tree layout)

Use the first path that exists as `{frontmatterScript}`. There is no manual fallback.

**If neither path exists, HALT** with the diagnostic below. test-skill is a quality gate; without the deterministic validator it cannot produce a trustworthy frontmatter verdict, and a silent manual check can miss subtle spec drift. The missing helper must be restored before testing continues:

```
Error: cannot locate skf-validate-frontmatter.py at either of:
  - {project-root}/_bmad/skf/shared/scripts/skf-validate-frontmatter.py
  - {project-root}/src/shared/scripts/skf-validate-frontmatter.py

test-skill requires the deterministic frontmatter validator. Install the
SKF module (`skf init`) or run from a development checkout with src/ present.
```

Do not proceed. No partial test report is written.

**3b. Python runtime probe (before invoking the validator).** Confirm both `python3` and `uv` are on `$PATH` (`command -v python3` and `command -v uv`). Both are required: `uv run` shells through to `python3` and honors the script's PEP 723 PyYAML dependency declaration that bare `python3` ignores (bare `python3` fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'` on a fresh interpreter — `docs/getting-started.md` documents uv as the runtime prereq for exactly this). If either is missing, set `analysis_confidence: degraded` in workflow context and carry a **score cap** into step 5: `capped_score = threshold - 1` → forces auto-FAIL until the runtime is restored. Record the reason in evidence-report and the test report frontmatter (`analysisConfidence: degraded`, `toolingStatus: python3-missing` or `uv-missing` as appropriate). `uv` is a documented runtime prerequisite — see `docs/getting-started.md` for install instructions.

**3c. Run the validator (30s timeout — the deterministic validator should finish in <1s; the cap only guards against runaway python).**

```bash
timeout 30s uv run {frontmatterScript} {resolved_skill_package}/SKILL.md --skill-dir-name {skill_name}
```

If the command trips the 30s wall-clock (exit code `124`), set
`analysis_confidence: degraded` and `toolingStatus: frontmatter-validator-timeout`
in workflow context, apply the step 5 tooling-degraded cap (score capped at
`threshold - 1` → auto-FAIL), and record the reason in evidence-report.

Parse the JSON output. Treat each `status` value explicitly:

- `status: "pass"` — continue silently.
- `status: "warn"` — display the warning below, log each issue as a pre-check finding, and continue with testing. Frontmatter issues surface in the gap report alongside coverage/coherence findings.
- `status: "fail"` — **HALT with auto-FAIL.** Frontmatter failure means the skill will be rejected by `npx skills add` and `npx skill-check check`; shipping it would produce a false PASS downstream. Write the halt note into evidence-report and exit non-zero. **Headless envelope (if `{headless_mode}`):** emit to **stderr** before halting. The output document does not exist yet (created in §6), so `report_path` is `null` — matching the other pre-report init HALTs (target-inaccessible, forge-tier-missing, workspace-drift, another-run-active). A frontmatter-invalid target is the most common failure this gate exists to catch, so a headless orchestrator must be able to branch on it (route to update-skill) rather than see an unlabelled non-zero exit:

```
SKF_TEST_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_name":"{skill_name}","verdict":null,"score":null,"threshold":null,"report_path":null,"next_workflow":null,"exit_code":1,"halt_reason":"frontmatter-invalid"}
```

```
**Warning/Error: SKILL.md frontmatter is non-compliant with agentskills.io specification.**

{list issues from the JSON output}

This skill will fail `npx skills add` and `npx skill-check check`. {If warn:} Consider fixing frontmatter before proceeding (run `npx skill-check check <skill-dir> --fix` to auto-fix deterministic issues). {If fail:} test-skill cannot proceed — halt and repair frontmatter, then re-run.
```

### 4. Load Forge Tier State

**`--tier=<...>` flag bypass (precedes the sidecar probe).** If `tier_flag` is set in workflow context (from §1's `--tier=<Quick|Forge|Forge+|Deep>` flag), validate the value against the allowed set. On valid match: set `detected_tier` directly to the flag's value, leave `ast_grep`/`gh_cli`/`qmd` availability flags unset (downstream steps treat unset as "unknown" — analysis proceeds without tool-specific enrichment), log Info note "tier — supplied via --tier flag, sidecar bypassed", and SKIP the sidecar probe and HALT below (jump straight to §4b "Apply Tier Override"). On invalid value (not one of the four), HALT with "Error: --tier=<value> is not one of Quick, Forge, Forge+, Deep".

**Otherwise (no `--tier` flag):** Read `{sidecarFile}` to determine available analysis depth.

**If forge-tier.yaml exists:**
- Read `tier` value (Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep)
- Read tool availability flags (ast_grep, gh_cli, qmd)

**If forge-tier.yaml missing:**
"**Cannot proceed.** forge-tier.yaml not found at `{sidecarFile}`. Please run the **setup** workflow first to configure your forge tier (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep), or re-run with `--tier=<Quick|Forge|Forge+|Deep>` to bypass the sidecar."

**Headless envelope (if `{headless_mode}`):** emit to **stderr**:

```
SKF_TEST_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_name":"{skill_name}","verdict":null,"score":null,"threshold":null,"report_path":null,"next_workflow":null,"exit_code":1,"halt_reason":"forge-tier-missing"}
```

HALT — do not proceed.

### 4b. Apply Tier Override (if set)

Read `{sidecar_path}/preferences.yaml`. If `tier_override` is set and is a valid tier value (Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep), update `detected_tier` to the override value for use in subsequent steps and output documents.

### 5. Load Skill Metadata

Read `metadata.json` to extract:
- `name` — display name
- `skill_type` — single or stack (needed for mode detection)
- `source_path` — path to source code (if present)
- `source_commit` — pinned commit the skill was extracted against (may be null for docs-only skills, `"local"` for non-git sources, or a per-repo map for stack skills)
- `source_ref` — pinned ref (tag/branch/`HEAD`) used at extraction time
- `generation_date` — when skill was generated
- `confidence_tier` — tier used during creation

If source path override was provided as optional input, use that instead.

### 5b. Verify Workspace HEAD Matches Pinned Commit

Test-skill reads `source_path` during coverage and coherence analysis. If the local workspace has drifted from `metadata.source_commit`, gap and signature-mismatch findings will silently reflect the drifted tree, not the skill's pinned source — producing false positives that downstream update-skill runs may then "repair" by corrupting correct documentation.

- Resolve `pinned_commit` from `metadata.source_commit`.
- **If `pinned_commit` is null, empty, or `"local"`:** skip the guard; log `workspace_drift_check: skipped (no pinned commit)` and continue to section 6.
- **If `pinned_commit` is a per-repo map (stack skills):** iterate each `{repo_path: commit}` entry — for each repo run `git -C "{repo_path}" rev-parse HEAD` and compare to its pinned commit (accept full-SHA or short-SHA-prefix match). If ANY repo diverges and the user did not pass `--allow-workspace-drift`, HALT with exit status `workspace-drift` listing every mismatched repo (in `{headless_mode}`, emit the same `workspace-drift` stderr envelope shown in the single-tree branch below before halting). On all-match: log `workspace_drift_check: ok (stack, {N} repos verified)` and continue to section 6. This guard must iterate every repo — do not skip stack skills.
- **If `source_path` is not a git working tree** (bare checkout, tarball extract, docs-only source) — detect by `git -C "{source_path}" rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, non-zero exit means skip: log `workspace_drift_check: skipped (not a git working tree)` and continue to section 6.
- **Otherwise** run `git -C "{source_path}" rev-parse HEAD` and compare to `pinned_commit`. Accept full-SHA or short-SHA-prefix match (stored pins are often 8-char short hashes — see `src/knowledge/provenance-tracking.md`).
  - **On match:** log `workspace_drift_check: ok ({short_sha})` and continue.
  - **On mismatch, AND the user did not pass `--allow-workspace-drift`:** HALT with exit status `workspace-drift`. Display:

    ```
    Workspace HEAD does not match the commit this skill was pinned against.

      pinned (metadata.source_commit): {pinned_commit}
      pinned ref (metadata.source_ref): {source_ref or "unset"}
      workspace HEAD ({source_path}):  {head_sha}

    Test-skill verifies against the source the skill was extracted from.
    Testing against a drifted tree produces false gaps/mismatches. Re-sync:

      git -C "{source_path}" checkout {source_ref or pinned_commit}

    Or re-run test-skill with `--allow-workspace-drift` to test against the
    current workspace (accepts that findings reflect HEAD, not the pin).
    ```

    **Headless envelope (if `{headless_mode}`):** emit to **stderr**:

    ```
    SKF_TEST_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_name":"{skill_name}","verdict":null,"score":null,"threshold":null,"report_path":null,"next_workflow":null,"exit_code":1,"halt_reason":"workspace-drift"}
    ```

    Do not proceed. The test report has not been created; no partial writes.
  - **On mismatch WITH `--allow-workspace-drift`:** log `workspace_drift_check: overridden (pinned={pinned_commit}, head={head_sha})`, carry the warning into the final report frontmatter (`workspaceDrift: overridden`), and set `allow_workspace_drift: true` in workflow context (consumed by step 5 §5 drift override — a PASS under drift is demoted to `pass-with-drift` and `nextWorkflow` is forced to `update-skill`, never `export-skill`). Continue.

### 6. Create Output Document

**6a. Generate `{run_id}`**: a per-run identifier of the form `{YYYYMMDDTHHmmssZ}-{pid}-{rand4}` (UTC timestamp + process PID + 4-char random hex). Store in workflow context. All per-run artifacts in this and subsequent steps must carry this suffix; step 6 verifies `testDate` in the resulting report matches the run's stamp and fail-fast otherwise.

**6b. Acquire the per-skill test lock**: `flock {forge_version}/.test-skill.lock` for the duration of this run to serialize concurrent `skf-test-skill` invocations against the same skill. If the lock is already held by another run, HALT with "another test-skill run is active for {skill_name}". **Headless envelope (if `{headless_mode}`):** emit to **stderr** before halting:

```
SKF_TEST_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_name":"{skill_name}","verdict":null,"score":null,"threshold":null,"report_path":null,"next_workflow":null,"exit_code":1,"halt_reason":"another-run-active"}
```

**6c. Create `{outputFile}` from `{templateFile}`** — use `{forge_version}/test-report-{skill_name}-{run_id}.md` Initial frontmatter:

```yaml
---
workflowType: 'test-skill'
skillName: '{skill_name}'
skillDir: '{skill_path}'
runId: '{run_id}'
testMode: ''
forgeTier: '{detected_tier}'
testResult: ''
score: ''
threshold: ''
analysisConfidence: '{full|degraded}'
toolingStatus: '{ok|python3-missing|uv-missing|frontmatter-validator-missing|frontmatter-validator-timeout}'
workspaceDrift: '{not-checked|ok|overridden}'
testDate: '{run_id timestamp ISO-8601 UTC}'
stepsCompleted: ['init']
nextWorkflow: ''
---
```

### 7. Report Initialization Status

Report initialization to the user: the resolved skill name, path, type, forge tier, and source path. Then proceed to mode detection.

Update stepsCompleted, then load and execute {nextStepFile}.
