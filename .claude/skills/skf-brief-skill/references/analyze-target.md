# Step 2: Analyze Target

## Rules

- Do not make scoping decisions or recommendations
- Do not hallucinate or guess about repository contents

## Sequence

### 1. Resolve Target Location

**For GitHub URLs:**

**Resolve the analysis ref first.** `{analysis_ref}` is the git ref every GitHub-API fetch in this step (tree, manifests, contents) reads from — resolve it before fetching anything so the analyzed structure matches the version being skilled:
- If neither `target_ref` nor `target_version` was set in step 01: `{analysis_ref}` = `HEAD` (default branch). This is the common case — skip straight to the probes below with no extra call.
- If `target_ref` is set (an explicit ref the user stated verbatim, highest priority): use it directly as `{analysis_ref}` — no tag lookup.
- If `target_version` is set: resolve it to a tag via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs/tags` (paginate if the repo has many tags), matching in priority order — exact `{target_version}`, then `v{target_version}`. This mirrors the clone-path tag matching in `skf-create-skill/references/source-resolution-protocols.md` (see that file for the full monorepo-tag priority if the simple forms miss). On a single match, set `{analysis_ref}` to that tag. On **multiple matches**, present them and ask which to use (headless: take the exact match, else the `v`-prefixed one). On **zero matches**, warn `"No git tag matches version {target_version}; analyzing the default branch (HEAD) instead — structure and exports may not match the pinned version."`, set `{analysis_ref}` = `HEAD`, and record the fallback in the §5 analysis summary.

- Issue both probes in **one message with two parallel Bash calls** — they are independent:
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}` (verify repo exists)
  - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{analysis_ref}?recursive=1` (fetch file tree at the resolved ref)
- If the repo-existence probe fails, fall through to the failure-class triage below; the tree response from the parallel call is discarded in that case.

**Truncation detection:** After receiving the tree response, check the `truncated` field in the JSON output. If `truncated: true`:
- Display: "Note: GitHub API returned a truncated tree response ({count} items). Full analysis may require a local clone."
- Record in analysis summary: "Tree listing is partial — some files may not appear in the analysis."
- For very large repos (>1000 files in tree response): offer a recovery path instead of just warning. Interactive — present:
  ```
  Tree is truncated. How would you like to proceed?
    [L] Clone locally and re-analyze (slower but complete)
    [P] Proceed with the partial tree (faster, may miss exports under deeper paths)
  ```
  On `[L]`: shallow-clone (`git clone --depth 1 {url} {tmp_dir}`), restart this section against the local path, and remove `{tmp_dir}` after the analysis summary in §5. On `[P]` (or under headless): record `tree_truncated: true` in the analysis summary and continue without HALT.

**On API failure (non-200 from `gh api`):**

Distinguish the failure class before reporting. In headless mode, every branch below emits the error envelope per **step 5 §4b** with its stated `halt_reason` before the HALT (pass the resolved `{skill_name}`, or the `"unknown"` placeholder documented in §4b if it is not yet set):
- Auto-run `gh auth status` and capture its output. If it reports an unauthenticated state or expired token: emit the error envelope per **step 5 §4b** with `halt_reason: "gh-auth-failed"`, then HALT (exit code 3, `halt_reason: "gh-auth-failed"`) — "**Error:** GitHub CLI is not authenticated. `gh auth status` says: `{captured output}`. Run `gh auth login` and retry."
- If `gh auth status` reports authenticated but the call still failed (404/403): emit the error envelope per **step 5 §4b** with `halt_reason: "target-inaccessible"`, then HALT (exit code 3, `halt_reason: "target-inaccessible"`) — "**Error:** Cannot access repository at `{url}`. The CLI is authenticated but the API returned `{status}`. Check the URL and that the account has access to private repositories if applicable."
- If `gh auth status` itself fails to run (binary missing): emit the error envelope per **step 5 §4b** with `halt_reason: "gh-auth-failed"`, then HALT (exit code 3, `halt_reason: "gh-auth-failed"`) — "**Error:** `gh` CLI not found on PATH. Install it from <https://cli.github.com> and re-run."

**For local paths:**
- Verify the directory exists
- List the directory tree
- If the path does not exist: HALT (exit code 3, `halt_reason: "target-inaccessible"`) — "**Error:** Directory not found at {path}. Verify the path is correct." In headless mode, emit the error envelope per **step 5 §4b** with `halt_reason: "target-inaccessible"` before the HALT (pass the resolved `{skill_name}`, or the `"unknown"` placeholder documented in §4b if it is not yet set), matching the GitHub-target failure branches above so a missing local path surfaces the same `SKF_BRIEF_RESULT_JSON` failure class.

Display: "**Resolving target...**"

### 1b. Detect Monorepo / Workspace Layout

**Resolve `{detectWorkspacesHelper}`** from `{detectWorkspacesProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. HALT if no candidate exists.

Delegate workspace detection to `{detectWorkspacesHelper}` instead of reasoning through manifest rules in prose. Build a payload from the tree fetched in §1 plus the small set of root manifests the detector needs, then invoke the script:

```bash
echo '{"tree": [<flat list of repo-relative file paths>], "manifests": {"package.json": "<raw text>", "Cargo.toml": "<raw text>", "pnpm-workspace.yaml": "<raw text>", "lerna.json": "<raw text>"}}' | \
  uv run {detectWorkspacesHelper}
```

- **`tree`** — pass the flat list of repo-relative file paths already fetched in §1 (for GitHub: the `path` values from the `gh api .../git/trees/{analysis_ref}?recursive=1` response; for local: the equivalent listing).
- **`manifests`** — only the root manifests need contents; child-workspace manifests are looked up from the tree by the script. Include any of `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `lerna.json` that appears at the repo root. Fetch them in **one message with N parallel Bash calls** (`gh api .../contents/{path}?ref={analysis_ref}` for GitHub, file reads for local), then base64-decode together. Per-workspace manifest contents (e.g. `packages/foo/package.json`) are optional — including them populates the workspace `name` field with the manifest's declared package name; omitting them falls back to the directory basename.

The script returns a JSON envelope: `{is_monorepo, manifest_kind, workspaces[], warnings[]}`. Apply the result deterministically — see `src/shared/scripts/schemas/workspace-detection.v1.json` for the full contract.

**If `is_monorepo: false`** — skip this section silently and continue to §2.

**If `is_monorepo: true`** — present the discovered workspaces and prompt:

```
This looks like a monorepo ({manifest_kind}) with these workspaces:
  1. {workspaces[0].name} ({workspaces[0].path})
  2. {workspaces[1].name} ({workspaces[1].path})
  ...
Which one should the skill cover? Pick a number, or type 'all' to scope at the repo root.
```

Interactive: wait for the user choice. On a numbered choice, store `monorepo_workspace: {path}` and rebase §2-§4b against that path. On `'all'`, leave `monorepo_workspace` unset and proceed at the repo root with a note in the analysis summary that scope is unfiltered.

Headless: if the input contract supplied an `include` glob that begins with one of the workspace paths, auto-select that workspace (log `"headless: auto-selected workspace {name} from include glob"`). Otherwise default to repo root and log `"warn: monorepo detected ({manifest_kind}) but no workspace pre-selected — analyzing at repo root"`.

Surface any non-empty `warnings[]` from the script to the operator log so a malformed root manifest is debuggable; the workflow does not HALT — falling back to repo-root analysis is always safe.

**`cross-ecosystem workspace ignored` warning:** when a root workspace manifest from a different language ecosystem co-exists with the surfaced one (e.g. a root `Cargo.toml [workspace]` alongside a pnpm workspace), the script surfaces only the higher-priority kind and emits this warning naming the ignored kind and its member count. The ignored ecosystem's workspaces are **not** in `workspaces[]`, so the numbered menu above will not list them. When this warning is present, tell the operator both ecosystems exist and ask which the skill should cover; if they pick the ignored ecosystem, scope §2-§4b at its root (or the relevant member) rather than the surfaced workspace, and carry the ignored kind into §3 (see the `workspace_signal` note there).

### 2. Read Repository Structure

List the top-level directory structure:

"**Repository Structure:**
```
{repo-name}/
├── {top-level files}
├── {top-level directories}/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
**Total:** {file count} files, {directory count} directories"

### 3. Detect Primary Language

**Resolve `{detectLanguageHelper}`** from `{detectLanguageProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. HALT if no candidate exists.

Delegate the rule walk to `{detectLanguageHelper}` instead of evaluating manifest presence and extension frequency in prose:

```bash
echo '{"tree": [<flat list of repo-relative file paths from §1>], "workspace_signal": "<§1b manifest_kind, or omit when null>"}' | uv run {detectLanguageHelper}
```

Pass the §1b `manifest_kind` as `workspace_signal` (omit the key when it is `null` / not a monorepo). This gives the workspace root precedence: for a `cargo-workspace` or `python-multi-package` root, the script returns the root language (rust/python) instead of being misled into `typescript` by a nested `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` in a non-workspace subdirectory (e.g. a `docs/` or `website/` site). JS-family workspace kinds (`npm-workspaces`/`pnpm-workspaces`/`lerna`) carry no override — their root `package.json` resolves js/ts normally.

**When §1b surfaced a `cross-ecosystem workspace ignored` warning and the operator chose the ignored ecosystem:** pass that ignored kind as `workspace_signal` (not the surfaced kind), so a co-located `cargo-workspace`/`python-multi-package` root resolves to rust/python instead of being pinned to the surfaced ecosystem's language by the workspace that won detection priority.

The script returns `{language, confidence, detection_source, fallback_to_extension_frequency}` after walking the documented rule table (the `workspace_signal` precedence above first, then manifest presence — package.json with tsconfig.json disambiguation, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml/setup.py/setup.cfg, go.mod, pom.xml, build.gradle.kts, build.gradle Groovy with Java/Kotlin disambiguation, *.csproj/*.sln, Gemfile — then extension-frequency fallback over recognized source extensions). Use the returned values directly:

"**Detected language:** {language}
**Confidence:** {confidence}
**Detection source:** {detection_source}"

**Headless language override.** If `language_hint` was supplied as a headless argument, use it as the confirmed `{language}` (overriding the detected value) and carry it forward to §4 and step 03. The detector still runs so the "Detected language" line reflects what the source signals, but the explicit hint wins and the step 03 §4 low-confidence override does not fire. When `language_hint` is absent, carry the detected `{language}` forward.

If `confidence` is `low` (or `unknown` is returned for `language`) and no `language_hint` was supplied: flag for user override in step 03 §4.

### 4. List Top-Level Modules and Exports

**Resolve `{extractPublicApiHelper}`** from `{extractPublicApiProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. HALT if no candidate exists.

Identify the public API surface. **Delegate the parsing to `{extractPublicApiHelper}` whenever the detected language is supported** — the script is the single source of truth for manifest parsing, export discovery, and version detection across the whole SKF pipeline. Hand-rolling these in prose creates drift seams the LLM cannot fully close.

**Script-supported languages** (use the script): `js`, `ts`, `javascript`, `typescript`, `python`, `rust`, `go`, `java`, `kotlin`.

This section runs exactly one of §4.1 (script path) or §4.2 (fallback path) based on the detected language, then always emits §4.3 (output format) and conditionally §4.4 (semantic signals).

#### 4.1 Procedure — script-supported languages

1. Read the relevant files into memory (no parsing yet — just collect content). For GitHub sources, issue **all N `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{file}?ref={analysis_ref}` calls in a single message with N parallel Bash calls** (one per manifest + each entry point), then base64-decode the responses together — these are 2-4 independent fetches per typical run. Carrying `{analysis_ref}` through here is what keeps the analyzed exports/version aligned with the pinned tag rather than HEAD. For local sources read directly (also parallelisable, but local reads are fast enough that serial Read tool calls are acceptable).

   | Language | Manifest | Entry points (mode=quick) |
   |----------|----------|--------------------------|
   | js / ts / javascript / typescript | `package.json` (root, or primary workspace package per `references/version-resolution.md`) | `index.{ts,js}` and/or `src/index.{ts,js}` if present |
   | python | `pyproject.toml` (or `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` if no `pyproject.toml`) | top-level `__init__.py` of the package, plus `_version.py` if present |
   | rust | `Cargo.toml` (`[package]` — workspace root if `version = { workspace = true }`) | `src/lib.rs` |
   | go | `go.mod` | top-level `*.go` exporting the package surface |
   | java | `pom.xml` | (manifest alone is sufficient for the modules listing) |
   | kotlin | `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` | (manifest alone) |

2. Build a JSON payload matching the script contract:

   ```json
   {
     "language": "<one of the supported values>",
     "manifest": {"path": "<relative path>", "content": "<file contents>"},
     "entries":  [{"path": "<relative path>", "content": "<file contents>"}, ...],
     "mode":     "quick"
   }
   ```

3. Invoke the script and parse its JSON stdout:

   ```bash
   echo '<payload-json>' | uv run {extractPublicApiHelper} --mode quick
   ```

   On a non-zero exit (codes 1 or 2 per the script's docstring), capture stderr, log it, and fall through to §4.2 (the prose-fallback path) — never HALT just because the script choked on an unusual manifest.

4. Render the returned `package_name`, `exports` (each entry's `name`/`type`/`source_file`), `dependencies`, and any `warnings` to the user. The script also returns `version` — feed that into §4b instead of re-deriving.

5. The script does not enumerate directories under `src/`. The LLM still lists those as "Top-Level Modules/Directories" so the user sees structural context (Maven and Gradle are the exception — for those, the script returns a `modules` array which IS the list).

#### 4.2 Procedure — fallback (not script-supported)

Languages outside the script coverage (Ruby / C# / Swift / etc.) take this path. The §4.1 fall-through on script error also lands here.

Fall back to ad-hoc inspection — `Gemfile` / `*.csproj` / `*.sln` / `Package.swift` / file extension frequency. List top-level source directories as potential modules and note any obvious entry points. Flag the limitation in the analysis summary so the user knows scoping is on coarser signals.

#### 4.3 Output format (both paths)

"**Top-Level Modules/Directories:**
{numbered list of modules with brief description of each}

**Detected Exports/Entry Points:**
{numbered list of public-facing items found — from script output when available, ad-hoc inspection otherwise}"

#### 4.4 Semantic Signals (Forge+/Deep with ccc only)

**Remote source guard:** If the target source was resolved via GitHub API (remote URL, not a local file path), skip this CCC subsection — CCC requires a local source index and cannot operate on remote-only sources. Note: "CCC semantic discovery skipped — target is remote. CCC discovery will run automatically during create-skill after the source is cloned."

If `tools.ccc` is true in forge-tier.yaml, supplement the module listing with a semantic discovery pass:

**CCC Semantic Discovery:**
- **Claude Code:** Use `/ccc search "{repo_name} public API exports modules" {source_path}`
- **Cursor:** Use `ccc` MCP server `search` tool with query `"{repo_name} public API exports modules"` and path `{source_path}`
- **CLI fallback:** `ccc search "{repo_name} public API exports modules" --path {source_path} --limit 10`

See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md` for full bridge-to-tool mapping.

If results are returned, display:

"**Semantic Signals (ccc):**
{numbered list of file:snippet pairs from CCC results — top 5 most relevant}"

This supplements — never replaces — the explicit module list above. CCC may surface non-obvious entry points (dynamically constructed exports, re-export chains) that static directory analysis misses.

If CCC is unavailable or returns no results: skip this subsection silently.

### 4b. Detect Source Version

**When the language was script-supported (§4 took the script path):** the `version` field returned by `{extractPublicApiHelper}` IS the detected version — do not re-derive it and do not load `{versionResolutionFile}`. The script already implements the language-specific lookups documented in that reference, so loading the reference here only burns context.

**When the language was not script-supported:** load `{versionResolutionFile}` and follow the prose Detection Algorithm directly (Ruby / C# / Swift / etc. fall outside the script's coverage).

Surface the result regardless of which path produced it:

**If `target_version` was provided in step 01:**
- Display: "**Target version:** {target_version} (user-specified)"

Display: "**Detected version:** {version or 'Not detected — will default to 1.0.0'}"

{If target_version was provided AND auto-detected version differs:}
"**Note:** Detected version ({detected_version}) differs from your target version ({target_version}). Using target version (per `references/version-resolution.md` precedence rules)."

If detection fails or returns a non-semver value: note that version will default to `"1.0.0"` and the user can override in step 04. The actual write happens in step 05.

### 5. Report Analysis Summary

Present the complete analysis:

"**Analysis Complete**

---

**Target:** {repo URL or path}
**Language:** {detected language} ({confidence})
**Structure:** {file count} files across {directory count} directories

**Key Modules ({count}):**
{bulleted list of modules}

**Public Exports/Entry Points ({count}):**
{bulleted list of exports}

**Notable Files:**
- README: {found/not found}
- Tests: {found/not found — location}
- Docs: {found/not found — location}
- Config: {list of config files found}
- Version: {detected version or "Not detected — defaulting to 1.0.0"}
{If the target was a GitHub URL:}
- Analysis ref: {analysis_ref} {append " (resolved from target_version {target_version})" when a tag was matched, or " (no tag matched {target_version} — analyzed default branch)" on the zero-match fallback}

Store `{analysis_ref}` in workflow context — step 03 (`scope-definition.md`) reuses it for any further `contents/` fetches so scope analysis reads the same ref as this step.

---

{If language confidence is low:}
**Note:** Language detection confidence is low. You'll be able to override this in the next step.

Moving to scope definition where you'll choose what to include and exclude."

### 6. Auto-Proceed to Scope Definition

Display: "**Proceeding to scope definition...**

Review the analysis above. If anything looks wrong, let me know now — otherwise I'll proceed to scope definition."

Pause briefly for user input. If the user provides corrections or asks questions, address them and re-present any updated analysis findings. Then proceed.

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- After analysis report is presented to user and any corrections addressed, load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}

#### Execution rules:

- This is a soft auto-proceed step — present the pause prompt, wait briefly for user input
- If user provides corrections: address them, then proceed
- If no user input after a brief pause: proceed directly to step 03
