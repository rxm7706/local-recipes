# Step 7: Generate Output Files

## STEP GOAL:

Write all deliverable and workspace artifact files to their target directories.

## Rules

- Write all output files in correct directory structure — do not modify compiled content from Step 06
- Create directory structure before writing files
- Report each file written with path and size

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Resolve Paths and Stage Target Directory

Resolve `{version}` per S11 below — the primary library version in code-mode, or the stack-local scheme in compose-mode (`1.0.0` for a new stack, or a bump of `{prior_stack_version}` on re-composition). The final artifact paths are:

```
{skill_group}                          # {skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/
{skill_package}                        # {skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/{version}/{project_name}-stack/
├── references/
│   └── integrations/
{forge_version}                        # {forge_data_folder}/{project_name}-stack/{version}/
```

Where the skill name is `{project_name}-stack` and `{version}` is the semver version (with build metadata stripped per `knowledge/version-paths.md`).

**Primary library definition (S11):** In code-mode, the primary library is the dependency with the highest import count from step 3; its `version` (from the manifest) becomes `{primary_library_version}`, falling back to `1.0.0` if unavailable. In compose-mode, the stack carries its own release identity: default `{version}` to `1.0.0` (a stack-local scheme) rather than borrowing the highest constituent semver. Constituent versions are preserved in `dependencies[]`, so no information is lost, and the stack's version does not track whichever constituent happens to have the highest version. The `1.0.0` default applies only to a **genuinely new** stack — see the re-composition rule below.

**Re-composition versioning (S11, compose-mode):** When the S3 pre-flight resolves a `{prior_stack_version}` (re-composing a stack that already has a release line), continue that line instead of resetting — defaulting to `1.0.0` would publish a version *below* the existing release (e.g. `1.0.0` shadowing a prior `3.0.5`, a backward jump). Bump `{prior_stack_version}`:

- **Major** if any library in `{prior_libraries}` is removed or replaced — dropping a documented library is breaking for consumers of the stack.
- **Minor** otherwise — libraries only added, and/or integration content changed (backward-compatible).

Never emit a `{version}` ≤ `{prior_stack_version}`. Narrate the resolved version and the bump rationale.

**Pre-flight: group-dir type check (S3):** If `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/` already exists, probe `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/active/{project_name}-stack/metadata.json`. If that metadata exists and `skill_type != "stack"`, HALT with:

"**Cannot proceed.** `{skills_output_folder}/{project_name}-stack/` exists but is not a stack skill (`skill_type={found_type}`). Rename the existing directory or choose a different `project_name` to avoid collision."

Do NOT proceed to staging or commit. Emit the result envelope on stderr per the Result Contract in SKILL.md and exit `4` (`stack_libraries` carries the confirmed library names; nothing was committed, so `skill_package` is `null`):

```
SKF_STACK_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_package":null,"skill_name":"{project_name}-stack","stack_libraries":["<confirmed-lib>", "..."],"mode":"{code|compose}","exit_code":4,"halt_reason":"write-failure"}
```

If that metadata exists and `skill_type == "stack"`, this run is a **re-composition**: capture its `version` as `{prior_stack_version}` and its `libraries` array as `{prior_libraries}` for the S11 re-composition rule above. If the group dir is absent — or exists but has no resolvable `active` stack metadata — treat this as a new stack and leave `{prior_stack_version}` unset.

**Atomic write strategy (C2 / B5):** All artifact writes for `{skill_package}` MUST stage into a temp directory first, then commit atomically via `skf-atomic-write.py commit-dir`. The active symlink flip only happens AFTER the commit succeeds.

Create the staging directory:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} stage-dir --target {skill_package}
```

After this call, writes land in `{skill_package}.skf-tmp/` (referred to below as `{skill_staging}`). Create the required subdirectories inside the staging dir:

```bash
mkdir -p {skill_staging}/references/integrations
```

Also create the forge workspace directory directly (these are workspace artifacts, not deliverables — they do not need stage-dir / commit-dir):

```bash
mkdir -p {forge_version}
```

**Rollback contract:** If ANY write in sections 2–7 below fails, immediately run:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} commit-dir --rollback --target {skill_package}
```

Then abort (see B7): purge any `{forge_version}/*-tmp` staging artifacts, emit the result envelope on stderr per the Result Contract in SKILL.md, and halt the workflow. This is the single rollback exit shared by §7 (workspace-write failure) and §9 (commit-dir failure):

```
SKF_STACK_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_package":null,"skill_name":"{project_name}-stack","stack_libraries":["<confirmed-lib>", "..."],"mode":"{code|compose}","exit_code":4,"halt_reason":"write-failure"}
```

### 2. Stage SKILL.md

Write the approved `skill_content` from step 06 to `{skill_staging}/SKILL.md` (regular write — the whole staging dir will be atomically committed later).

### 3. Stage Per-Library Reference Files

For each confirmed library, write `{skill_staging}/references/{library_name}.md`:

Load structure from `{stackSkillTemplatePath}` references section:
- Library name, version from manifest (**in compose-mode**: version from source skill `metadata.json`)
- Import count and file count (**in compose-mode**: export count from source skill metadata)
- Key exports with signatures
- Usage patterns with file:line citations (**in compose-mode**: usage patterns from source skill SKILL.md)
- Confidence tier label

**If the catalog was extracted** (large stack — step 06 §4 placed the `Library Reference Index` + `Per-Library Summaries` out of SKILL.md), also write `{skill_staging}/references/stack-catalog.md` using the structure in `{stackSkillTemplatePath}`, and confirm SKILL.md carries the inline pointer instead of the two sections. Small stacks keep the catalog inline and write no `stack-catalog.md`.

### 4. Stage Integration Pair Reference Files

For each detected integration pair, write `{skill_staging}/references/integrations/{libraryA}-{libraryB}.md`:

Load structure from `{stackSkillTemplatePath}` integrations section:
- Library pair and integration type
- Co-import file count
- Integration pattern description with file:line citations
- Usage convention
- Confidence tier label

**If no integrations detected:** Skip this section (no files to write).

### 5. Stage context-snippet.md

Write `{skill_staging}/context-snippet.md`:

Use the Vercel-aligned indexed format targeting **~80-120 tokens** (M2). Token estimation is heuristic — use `ceil(char_count / 4)` as the working approximation (the standard rule-of-thumb for English text in BPE-style tokenizers; precise counts differ per model). Compute against the rendered snippet body (excluding trailing newline).

```
[{project_name}-stack v{version — resolved in §1}]|root: skills/{project_name}-stack/
|IMPORTANT: {project_name}-stack — read SKILL.md before writing integration code. Do NOT rely on training data.
|stack: {dep-1}@{v1}, {dep-2}@{v2}, {dep-3}@{v3}
|integrations: {pattern-1}, {pattern-2}
|gotchas: {1-2 most critical integration pitfalls}
```

**Overflow strategy (M2):** If the estimated token count exceeds **120 tokens**, trim in this fixed order until under budget:

1. **Drop the `gotchas` line first.** Pitfalls live in SKILL.md and references; the snippet's job is discovery, not full warning surface.
2. **Strip versions from the `stack` line** (`{dep-1}, {dep-2}` instead of `{dep-1}@{v1}`). Versions are recoverable from `metadata.json`.
3. **Truncate the `stack` list to the top 8 dependencies by import count** (or by export count in compose-mode), appending `, ...+{N} more`.
4. **Truncate the `integrations` list to the top 5 by file count**, appending `, ...+{N} more`.

If the snippet is still over budget after step 4, log a warning to workflow_warnings (see Workflow Rules in SKILL.md) — do not block the write. The `IMPORTANT:` line is mandatory and never trimmed.

**Underflow note:** Snippets below ~80 tokens are acceptable (small stacks naturally produce short snippets). The lower bound is informational, not enforced.

### 6. Stage metadata.json

Write `{skill_staging}/metadata.json`, populating every field from the metadata.json schema in `{stackSkillTemplatePath}` (loaded in §3) — that template is the single schema source; do not re-transcribe it here. Resolve the field values whose template placeholders don't spell out the rule:

- `version` — the `{version}` resolved in §1 (not the template's literal `1.0.0`, which is only the new-stack default).
- `forge_tier` — the run tier (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep) resolved in step 1.
- `confidence_tier` — the dominant T-code from `confidence_distribution`. Pick the tier with the highest count; resolve ties toward the weaker tier (T1-low > T1, T2 > T1-low, T3 > T2) so the reported value never overstates confidence. When `confidence_distribution` is empty (no libraries extracted), emit `"T1-low"` as the conservative default.
- `source_authority` — the lowest authority among constituent skills (official > community > internal).

### 7. Write Forge Data Artifacts (Workspace)

Write workspace artifacts directly to `{forge_version}` (these are workspace-only, not part of the skill package — no staging required). Each individual file MUST be written via `skf-atomic-write.py write` to avoid partial-write corruption:

```bash
<json-content> | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {forge_version}/provenance-map.json
<md-content>   | python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {forge_version}/evidence-report.md
```

If any workspace write fails, invoke the rollback contract from §1.

**provenance-map.json:**

Use the schema from `{provenanceMapSchemaPath}` — see that asset for the canonical templates and field definitions of both variants:

- **In code-mode:** use the code-mode variant (`source_repo` / `source_commit` populated; `extraction_method` ∈ `ast_bridge|source_reading|qmd_bridge`; `detection_method = "co-import grep"`).
- **In compose-mode:** use the compose-mode variant (source-anchor fields `null`; `extraction_method = "compose-from-skill"`; `detection_method ∈ "architecture_co_mention|constituent_documented_contract|inferred_from_shared_domain"`; includes the additional `constituents[]` array for drift detection).

Populate compose-mode `constituents[].metadata_hash` from the value stored in workflow state at step 2 (S13), not a fresh re-hash at step-7 time — `{provenanceMapSchemaPath}` carries the rationale for why the manifest-detection-time hash is the correct provenance anchor.

**evidence-report.md:**
- Extraction summary per library
- Integration detection results per pair
- Warnings and failures encountered
- Confidence tier distribution

### 8. Pre-Commit Frontmatter & Body-Size Gate

The full schema/frontmatter validation runs in step 8 (`validate.md`) — but that runs *after* commit-dir and flip-link have already published the package. The most common non-auto-fixable `skill-check` hard rejects — a `description` over the 1024-char limit (which `skill-check --fix` cannot trim for you) and a SKILL.md body over the `body.max_lines` limit (default **500**) — would therefore only surface on an already-committed, symlink-active artifact, forcing edits to the live `SKILL.md`. `skill-check` also *warns* (non-blocking) when the body exceeds `body.max_tokens` (default **5000**). Additive re-composition of an already-large stack grows the body monotonically, so body overflow is the likeliest trigger. Catch these here, while the package is still in `.skf-tmp`.

Resolve `{frontmatterValidator}` from `{frontmatterValidatorProbeOrder}` (first existing path wins). Run it against the **staged** `SKILL.md`, passing the real skill name so the directory-match check is not fooled by the `.skf-tmp` staging suffix, `--max-body-lines 500` to assert the skill-check body-line limit, and `--max-body-tokens 5000` to surface the skill-check body-token *warning* pre-commit (advisory — see disposition below):

```bash
uv run {frontmatterValidator} {skill_staging}/SKILL.md --skill-dir-name {project_name}-stack --max-body-lines 500 --max-body-tokens 5000
```

The validator emits JSON: `status` (`pass`/`warn`/`fail`), `issues[]` (each with `severity` ∈ `high|medium|low`, `field`, `message`), `body_lines` (the counted body size), `body_tokens` (the estimated token count), and `summary`. Disposition:

- **`status` is `fail`, OR any `issues[]` entry has `severity` `high` or `medium`** — a hard violation that `npx skill-check` (step 8) would reject and `--fix` cannot auto-correct. HALT-to-fix **in staging**, then re-run the validator until it clears. Remediate by `field`:
  - `description` / `name` / `compatibility` — trim/correct `{skill_staging}/SKILL.md` (e.g. shorten `description` to ≤ 1024 chars).
  - `body` (`body lines N exceeds max 500`) — reduce the staged body: prefer a **selective split** of the largest Tier-2 section(s) into `{skill_staging}/references/`, keeping Tier-1 content inline (mirrors `validate.md` §3); or trim redundant content. Re-run the gate until `body_lines ≤ 500`. (An over-`body_tokens` estimate is advisory, not a hard stop — see the low-severity note below.)

  Do NOT proceed to §9 commit-dir with an unresolved high/medium issue. Note: an over-long `description` is rated `medium` and exits `0`, so key the HALT on the issue severities above — not on the exit code.
- **Only `low`-severity issues (e.g. an unexpected field, or a `body token estimate N exceeds max 5000` advisory)** — record each as a WARNING in the evidence report and proceed; these do not block the commit. The body-token estimate is a char/4 heuristic that runs higher than `skill-check`'s own whitespace-split count, and `skill-check` treats `body.max_tokens` as a non-blocking warning — so an over-token estimate is advisory here, not a HALT (the `body.max_lines` gate above remains the hard body pre-check).

**If `{frontmatterValidator}` does not resolve** (neither probe path exists) **or the invocation cannot run**, emit a WARNING ("pre-commit frontmatter + body-size gate skipped — validator unavailable") and proceed. Step 8 (`validate.md`) remains the post-commit backstop (including the `body.max_lines` split path in its §3); this gate is a best-effort early catch, never a new hard dependency.

### 9. Commit Staging Directory

After all staged writes in sections 2–6 completed successfully, atomically swap the staging dir into place:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} commit-dir --target {skill_package}
```

The helper moves any existing `{skill_package}` aside to a `.skf-rollback-<pid>` dir before the swap. On failure the helper restores the prior target and exits non-zero — in that case invoke the rollback contract from §1 and HALT.

### 10. Flip Active Symlink

ONLY AFTER `commit-dir` succeeds, flip the `{skill_group}/active` symlink to point at `{version}`:

```bash
python3 {atomicWriteHelper} flip-link --link {skill_group}/active --target {version}
```

The helper holds an flock on `{skill_group}/active.skf-lock` and refuses to replace a non-symlink at `{skill_group}/active` — this guards against accidentally overwriting a real directory (ECH BLOCKER 6/B6). After the flip, `{skill_group}/active/{project_name}-stack/` resolves to the just-committed skill package.

If `flip-link` fails, emit a warning (the committed package is still valid), note the symlink-flip failure in the evidence report, and continue.

### 11. Display Write Summary

Report the files written: the `{skill_package}` deliverables (SKILL.md with `{line_count}` lines, context-snippet.md with `{token_estimate}` tokens, metadata.json, `references/` `{lib_count}` library files, `references/integrations/` `{pair_count}` integration files), the `{forge_version}` workspace (provenance-map.json, evidence-report.md), the `{skill_group}/active -> {version}` symlink, and the `{total_count}` total.

### 12. Auto-Proceed to Next Step

Load, read the full file and then execute `{nextStepFile}`.
