# Step 4: Map Exports and Detect Integrations

## STEP GOAL:

To analyze each qualifying unit's export surface and import graph, detect cross-unit integration points, and flag potential stack skill candidates — completing the analysis foundation needed for recommendations.

## Rules

- Delegate per-unit deep analysis to a subagent when available (parallelizes across units; main-thread fallback is fine)
- For each qualifying unit, perform thorough export surface analysis — do not shortcut
- Do not make recommendations (Step 05)
- Tier-aware depth: Quick (file-level), Forge (AST), Deep (AST + semantic)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Load Context

Read {outputFile} to obtain:
- Qualifying units from Identified Units section (names, paths, scope types, languages)
- `forge_tier` from frontmatter

Load {heuristicsFile} for stack skill candidate detection rules.

### 2. Map Export Surfaces Per Unit (Subagent Fan-Out)

For each qualifying unit, delegate deep analysis to a subagent so per-unit work runs in parallel and the parent's context stays clean.

**Subagent fan-out protocol:**

1. **Build the qualifying-unit list.** Read the unit list produced upstream (Step §3 / §4 outputs already in workflow context — names, paths, scope types, languages, file counts). Do not re-scan the project here.

2. **Delegate per-unit deep analysis to a subagent.** For each qualifying unit, launch a subagent task with these explicit constraints:
   - The subagent reads only that unit's directory tree
   - The subagent analyzes exports / usage / CCC signals / scripts+assets for that one unit
   - **The parent does not read the unit's source files before delegating** (avoid the implicit-read trap — the whole point of fan-out is to keep large source bodies out of the parent's context)

3. **Per-unit analysis the subagent performs (scaled by size-aware strategy):**

   **Size-aware strategy selection:**
   - **< 50 files:** Full export scan — analyze every file for exports
   - **50-200 files:** Targeted scan — entry points (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`) + public modules + barrel exports only
   - **200+ files:** Entry-point strategy — analyze top-level entry point for public API surface, list submodule entry points, analyze each submodule entry point only. Report coverage confidence based on percentage of files analyzed.

   **Tier-aware depth:**
   - **Quick tier:** Count files by type, identify index/barrel files, list directory structure
   - **Forge tier:** Parse export statements, identify public API surface, count exported functions/classes/types
   - **Forge+ tier:** All Forge analysis plus:
     - If `tools.ccc` is true: run `ccc_bridge.search("{unit_name} exports public API", top_k=15)` to discover semantically relevant files beyond directory scan. Tool resolution: prefer the `/ccc` skill search (Claude Code) or ccc MCP server (Cursor); fall back to the `ccc search` CLI if neither is available; if no ccc tool resolves, skip CCC discovery and record `ccc: unavailable` in per-unit findings.
     - Merge CCC-discovered files with scoped file list — files from CCC that are within the unit's directory are added to the analysis queue
     - Record CCC signals in per-unit findings: top 3 CCC-ranked file names (or "—" if no ccc results)
   - **Deep tier:** All Forge analysis plus:
     - ast-grep structural export extraction: `ast-grep -p 'export $$$' --lang typescript` or equivalent per language to build a verified export inventory
     - ast-grep type/interface mapping: `ast-grep -p 'interface $NAME' --lang typescript` or `ast-grep -p 'class $NAME($$$)' --lang python`
     - If QMD available: query for temporal evolution of identified exports (deprecation signals, recent additions, refactoring patterns)
     - Record semantic relationships between exports (which exports reference/depend on each other)

   **Subagent must also record:**
   - Script/asset presence: check for `scripts/`, `bin/`, `assets/`, `templates/` directories and files matching detection signals in `{heuristicsFile}`
   - Analysis strategy used and coverage confidence

4. **Subagent return contract.** Each subagent returns only this JSON object — no prose, no commentary, no markdown fences:

   ```json
   {
     "unit_name": "...",
     "files_count": N,
     "exports_count": N,
     "export_pattern": "...",
     "api_surface": ["..."],
     "scripts_assets": {"scripts": [], "assets": []},
     "ccc_signals": {"top_files": [], "available": <bool>},
     "strategy_used": "ast-grep|regex|main-thread",
     "confidence": "T1|T2|T1-low"
   }
   ```

5. **Parent post-processing.** Strip any wrapping markdown fences (subagents sometimes wrap JSON in ` ```json … ``` ` despite the contract) before parsing. Validate each payload against the contract; if a key is missing, log a warning to `workflow_warnings[]` and continue with that unit's degraded record.

6. **Aggregate.** Collect all per-unit JSON payloads into `per_unit_findings[]` in workflow context for use by §3 (import graph), §4 (integration points), §5 (stack candidates), §6 (findings presentation), and downstream stages (recommend.md, generate-briefs.md).

**Per-unit export summary (built from `per_unit_findings[]`):**

| Unit | Files | Exports | Export Pattern | API Surface | Scripts/Assets | CCC Signals |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| {name} | {count} | {count} | {pattern} | {small/medium/large} | {N scripts, M assets or --} | {CCC signals or --} |

**Graceful degradation.** If subagents are unavailable in the current runtime, the parent performs the per-unit analysis sequentially in the main thread using the same size-aware strategy and tier-aware depth as above. Each main-thread analysis still produces the same JSON record shape so downstream stages remain agnostic to the execution mode. Record `strategy_used: "main-thread"` for every unit processed this way.

### 3. Map Import Graph

For each qualifying unit, analyze inbound and outbound imports:

**Outbound imports (this unit imports from):**
- Which other qualifying units does it depend on?
- Which external dependencies does it use?

**Inbound imports (other units import from this):**
- Which other qualifying units consume this unit's exports?
- How many import sites exist?

**Build cross-reference matrix:**

| Unit | Imports From | Imported By | External Deps |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| {name} | {list units} | {list units} | {count} |

### 4. Detect Integration Points

Identify cross-unit integration patterns:

**Direct integrations:**
- Unit A imports from Unit B → document the interface boundary
- Shared type definitions across units
- Cross-unit function calls

**For each integration point document:**
- Source unit → Target unit
- Integration type (import, shared types, API call, message passing, shared state)
- Files involved (with paths)
- Coupling strength (tight / loose / indirect)

### 5. Flag Stack Skill Candidates

Check each of the four stack-skill indicators defined in {heuristicsFile}'s Stack Skill Candidate Detection section — co-import frequency, integration adapter, shared state, orchestration layer — against the units.

**For each candidate, document:**
- Units involved
- Detection signal
- Recommended stack skill grouping
- Evidence (specific files/lines)

### 6. Present Findings

"**Export Mapping and Integration Detection Complete**

**Export Map Summary:**
{Per-unit export summary table}

**Cross-Reference Matrix:**
{Import graph matrix}

**Integration Points:** {count}
{List each integration with source → target, type, coupling}

**Stack Skill Candidates:** {count}
{List each candidate with units involved and detection signal}

**Observations:**
- {Key architectural patterns observed}
- {Tightly coupled areas}
- {Loosely coupled areas ideal for independent skills}

Does this analysis look complete? Any integration patterns I should investigate further?"

Wait for user feedback. Adjust analysis based on user input.

### 7. Append to Report

Append the complete "## Export Map" section to {outputFile}:
Replace `[Appended by map-and-detect]` under Export Map with:
- Per-unit export summary table
- Export pattern analysis

Append the complete "## Integration Points" section to {outputFile}:
Replace `[Appended by map-and-detect]` under Integration Points with:
- Cross-reference matrix
- Integration point details
- Stack skill candidate flags

Update {outputFile} frontmatter:
```yaml
stepsCompleted: [append 'map-and-detect' to existing array]
lastStep: 'map-and-detect'
stack_skill_candidates: [{list flagged candidate groupings}]
```

### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select:** [C] Continue to Recommendations | [D] Discover Additional Source"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Save findings to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF D: Accept a new repo path/URL from the user. Run a lightweight scan (directory structure + manifest detection from step 02) and classify (unit identification from step 03) for the new source only. Merge results into the existing report — append new units to the unit list, update `project_paths[]` in frontmatter. Then redisplay this step's export mapping for the new units before returning to the menu.
- IF Any other: help user, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#8-present-menu-options)

**GATE [default: C]** — present the menu and wait for the user's choice. If `{headless_mode}`: auto-proceed with [C] Continue past export/integration findings, log: "headless: auto-continue past integration analysis".
