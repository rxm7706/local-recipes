# Custom PyPI to conda-forge Package Name Mappings
# ================================================
#
# These mappings override all automatic sources (highest priority).
# Use this file to:
#   - Fix incorrect mappings from upstream sources
#   - Add new mappings before they appear in upstream sources
#   - Document edge cases specific to your workflow
#
# Format:
#   pypi-package-name:
#     conda_name: conda-package-name
#     import_name: python_import_name  # optional
#     reason: "Why this override exists"  # optional
#
# Example:
#   my-special-package:
#     conda_name: my_special_package
#     import_name: my_special_package
#     reason: "Custom conda-forge build with patches"
#
# Common patterns:
#   - PyPI uses hyphens, conda-forge uses underscores
#   - Some packages have completely different names (docker → docker-py)
#   - Import names may differ from package names (scikit-learn → sklearn)

# Known edge cases not in upstream sources:
# (Add your custom mappings below)
