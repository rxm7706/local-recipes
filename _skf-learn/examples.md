## What the Output Looks Like

When SKF generates a skill, you get a `SKILL.md` file with machine-readable frontmatter and provenance-backed instructions. Below is a trimmed example from the real [`oms-cognee` SKILL.md](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/skills/oms-cognee/1.0.0/oms-cognee/SKILL.md) generated for [cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) (full portfolio at [oh-my-skills](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills)):

**Frontmatter (tells AI agents when to load this skill):**

```yaml
name: oms-cognee
description: >
  Builds apps on top of cognee v1.0.0, the knowledge-graph memory engine for AI agents.
  Use when ingesting text/files/URLs into persistent memory, building knowledge graphs,
  searching graph-backed memory with multiple SearchType modes, enriching graphs with
  memify/improve, scoping memory with datasets and node_sets, configuring LLM/embedding/
  graph/vector backends, running custom task pipelines, tracing operations, decorating
  agent entrypoints with `agent_memory`, connecting to Cognee Cloud with `serve`, or
  visualizing the graph. Covers cognee/__init__.py exports: the V1 API (add, cognify,
  search, memify, datasets, prune, update, run_custom_pipeline, config, SearchType,
  visualize_graph, pipelines, Drop, run_startup_migrations, tracing) and the V2
  memory-oriented API (remember, RememberResult, recall, improve, forget, serve,
  disconnect, visualize, agent_memory). Do NOT use for: cognee internals, the HTTP
  REST API (use cognee-mcp or the FastAPI server), non-cognee memory/RAG libraries.
```

**Body (what your AI agent reads):**

```

Every line number above is verbatim from the real [`forge-data/oms-cognee/1.0.0/provenance-map.json`](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/forge-data/oms-cognee/1.0.0/provenance-map.json) shipped with oh-my-skills — not illustrative.

Provenance tags trace each instruction to its source:
- `[AST:file:line]` — extracted from code via AST parsing (highest confidence)
- `[SRC:file:line]` — read from source code without AST verification
- `[EXT:url]` — sourced from external documentation
- `[QMD:collection:doc]` — surfaced from indexed developer discourse (issues, PRs, changelogs)

This is the real directory listing from [`oh-my-skills/skills/oms-cognee/`](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/tree/main/skills/oms-cognee) after cognee shipped v1.0.0 upstream. SKF recompiled the skill from the v1.0.0 commit and wrote it next to the existing 0.5.8 tree — the older version stays pinned to its original commit (`b51dcce1`) and is still installable by any project that hasn't bumped its `CLAUDE.md` pin yet. The `active` symlink and the [`.export-manifest.json`](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills/blob/main/skills/.export-manifest.json) both point at the current version. Some skills also include `scripts/` and `assets/` directories when the source repository contains executable scripts or static assets — oms-cognee doesn't have either, but see [Skill Model → Per-Skill Output](../skill-model/#per-skill-output) for the full schema.

## Example Workflows

### Quick Skill — Under a minute

Developer adds [cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) to a Python project for AI memory management. Agent keeps hallucinating method signatures and config options.

```
@Ferris QS https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee
```

Ferris reads the repository, extracts the public API, and validates against the agentskills.io spec. The skill is written to `skills/cognee/<version>/cognee/` (auto-detected from the source manifest). The agent now reads the real signatures from the skill instead of guessing.

Need a specific version? Append `@version`:

```
@Ferris QS cognee@1.0.0
```

### Brownfield Platform — Pipeline or per-workflow

Alex, a platform engineer, adopts BMAD for 10 microservices spanning TypeScript, Go, and Rust.

```
@Ferris SF                                              # Setup — Deep tier detected
# — clear session —
@Ferris forge-auto https://github.com/acme/auth-service   # one service: Analyze → Brief → Create → Test → Export
```

Or one workflow per session:
```
@Ferris SF          # Setup — Deep tier detected
# — clear session —
@Ferris AN          # Analyze — 10 services mapped
# — clear session —
@Ferris CS --batch  # Create — batch generation
```

10 individual skills + 1 platform stack skill. The [BMM](../bmad-synergy/#skf-and-bmm-phase-by-phase-playbook) architect then navigates cross-service flows using verified knowledge.

### Release Prep — Trust Builder

Jin, a Rust library maintainer, is preparing v1.0.0 with breaking changes she wants consumers' agents to pick up automatically.

```
@Ferris maintain cocoindex
```

Or one workflow per session:
```
@Ferris AS    # Audit — finds 3 renames, 1 removal, 1 addition
# — clear session —
@Ferris US    # Update — preserves [MANUAL] sections, adds annotations
# — clear session —
@Ferris TS    # Test — verify completeness
# — clear session —
@Ferris EX    # Export — package for npm release
```

Ships with the npm release. Consumers upgrade and their agents use the correct function names — no more "wrong signature" support tickets.

### Stack Skill — Integration Intelligence

Armel, building a full-stack side project on Next.js + Serwist + SpacetimeDB + better-auth.

```
@Ferris SS
```

Ferris detects 8 significant dependencies, finds 5 co-import integration points. Generates a consolidated stack skill. The agent now knows: "When you modify the auth flow, update the Serwist cache exclusion at `src/sw.ts:L23`." That integration detail isn't available from any other tool in the [comparison table](/#how-skf-compares).

### Pre-Code Architecture Verification — Greenfield Confidence

Gery, a backend architect, is designing a new TypeScript service on Hono + Drizzle + SpacetimeDB. Architecture doc is written but no code exists yet — he wants to verify the stack holds together before anyone starts building.

```
@Ferris QS hono          # Quick Skill per library
@Ferris QS drizzle-orm
@Ferris QS spacetimedb-sdk
@Ferris VS               # Verify Stack — feasibility report
@Ferris RA               # Refine Architecture — enrich with API evidence
@Ferris SS               # Stack Skill — compose-mode (no codebase needed)
```

VS flags the Drizzle↔SpacetimeDB integration as incompatible (query-model mismatch) and returns CONDITIONALLY FEASIBLE. Gery adds a bridge layer to the architecture, re-runs VS → FEASIBLE. RA fills in verified API signatures. SS compose-mode synthesizes the stack skill from existing skills + refined architecture. The agent now has integration intelligence for a project that doesn't have code yet.

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario A: Greenfield + BMM Integration

BMAD user starts a new project. [BMM](../bmad-synergy/#skf-and-bmm-phase-by-phase-playbook) architect suggests skill generation after retrospective.

```
@Ferris BS    # Brief — scope the skill
@Ferris CS    # Create — compile from brief
@Ferris TS    # Test — verify completeness
@Ferris EX    # Export — inject into platform context files
```

Skills accumulate over sprints. The agent's coverage improves each iteration.

### Scenario B: Multi-Repo Platform

Blondin, a platform lead, needs cross-service knowledge for 10 microservices so agents can navigate shared types and cross-calls.

```
@Ferris campaign    # Orchestrate all 10 skills across sessions, in dependency order
```

Campaign reads the dependency graph, sorts the skills topologically, and drives each one through the full pipeline (brief, generate, compile, test) with quality gates enforced. State is written to disk, so Blondin can walk away and `@Ferris campaign resume` after a context death or a session break — picking up exactly where the last session stopped. One forge project, multiple QMD collections, hub-and-spoke skills with integration patterns. See [Campaign Orchestration](../campaign/) for the full stage-by-stage flow.

### Scenario C: External Dependency

Kossi, a developer integrating an uncommon library, needs a skill for it — nothing official exists yet.

```
@Ferris QS better-auth
```

Checks ecosystem first. If no official skill exists: generates from source. `source_authority: community`.

### Scenario D: Docs-Only (SaaS/Closed Source)

No source code to clone — only API documentation. Example: you're integrating the [Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) and want your agent to know the real endpoints, parameters, and error codes instead of hallucinating from training data.

```
@Ferris BS
# When asked for target, provide documentation URLs:
# https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges
# https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents
# https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors
# Ferris sets source_type: "docs-only" and collects doc_urls
# When asked for target version, specify: 2025-04-30.basil
# Ferris confirms your doc URLs match that API version
@Ferris CS
# step 3 skips (no source to clone), step 3c fetches docs via doc_fetcher
# All content is T3 [EXT:url] confidence. source_authority: community
```

The brief's `doc_urls` field drives the doc_fetcher step. The agent uses whatever web fetching tool is available in its environment (Firecrawl, WebFetch, curl, etc.) to retrieve documentation as markdown and extract API information with `[EXT:url]` citations. No AST parsing is possible without source code — every instruction carries T3 provenance instead of T1, and the skill is tagged `source_authority: community` regardless of tier.

### Scenario E: Rename a Skill

You generated a quick skill for `cognee` and now want a more specific name to distinguish it from the official one.

```
@Ferris RS
# Ferris asks: Which skill? → cognee
# Ferris asks: New name? → cognee-skf-community
# Ferris copies to new name across all versions, verifies every reference,
# updates the export manifest, rebuilds CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md,
# then deletes the old name.
```

Transactional safety: if verification fails, the old skill stays intact.

### Scenario F: Drop a Deprecated Version

You have `cognee` with versions 0.1.0, 0.5.0, and 0.6.0 (active). Version 0.1.0 is obsolete.

```
@Ferris DS
# Ferris asks: Which skill? → cognee
# Ferris asks: Which version? → 0.1.0
# Ferris asks: Deprecate (keep files) or Purge (delete)? → Purge
# Ferris updates the manifest, rebuilds context files, deletes the 0.1.0 directory.
```

Version 0.6.0 remains active. Version 0.5.0 is untouched. The managed sections in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md no longer reference 0.1.0.

### Scenario G: Maximum Accuracy for a High-Stakes Library

You're building skills for a production payments library and need maximum citation density. Every signature must be AST-verified, and you want historical context (deprecations, migration notes) baked into the skill.

**Workflow:**

```
@Ferris SF
# Ferris detects installed tools and sets your tier automatically:
# - Quick: no tools required (best-effort, source-read only)
# - Forge: + ast-grep (T1 AST-verified signatures)
# - Forge+: + cocoindex-code (semantic pre-ranking for large repos)
# - Deep: + gh + qmd (T2 evidence — issues, PRs, changelogs)
# Install the missing tools, then re-run @Ferris SF to promote your tier.
@Ferris BS    # Scope — confirm the forge tier is Deep (+ ccc if installed)
@Ferris CS    # Extract — AST + QMD enrichment
@Ferris TS    # Completeness score — 80%+ threshold
```

**What you get:** Every signature carries `[AST:file:Lnn]` at T1. Deprecation warnings and design rationale carry `[QMD:collection:doc]` at T2. Install tooling once, every downstream skill benefits. See [Capability Tiers](../concepts/#capability-tiers-quickforgeforgedeep).

### Scenario H: OSS Maintainer Publishing Official Skills

You maintain an OSS library and want to ship official agent skills alongside each release — distributed via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) or [oh-my-skills](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/oh-my-skills) so consumers install them with `npx skills add`.

**Workflow:**

```
@Ferris BS    # Scope the skill — set source_authority: official in the brief
@Ferris CS    # Compile — AST extraction + QMD enrichment (Deep tier recommended)
@Ferris TS    # Verify completeness before publishing (target: 90%+)
@Ferris EX    # Package for distribution — emits npx skills publish instructions
```

**What you get:** A verified skill pinned to the release commit, with `source_authority: official` surfaced in metadata as a trust signal so downstream tooling (and the ecosystem check in `@Ferris QS`) recognize it as maintainer-published rather than community-forged. Re-run `@Ferris maintain <skill>` (AS → US → TS → EX) on every release to keep published skills current.

## Tips & Tricks

### Skip Permissions for Faster Forging

> **Tip from Armel:** When forging skills with Claude Code, I run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass all permission prompts. SKF workflows only read source code, write to `skills/` and `forge-data/`, and call local tools (ast-grep, qmd, gh) — every step is auditable in the [open source](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/bmad-module-skill-forge). Skipping permissions drastically reduces forge time: I start a pipeline, go [grab one of those coffees ☕ you keep offering](https://buymeacoffee.com/armelhbobdad), and come back to a completed workflow. Review the output at the end, not at every gate.

### Progressive Capability

Start with the Quick tier (no setup required), upgrade to Forge (install ast-grep), then Forge+ (install cocoindex-code for semantic discovery), then Deep (install QMD). Each tier builds on the previous — you never lose capability.

### Batch Operations

Use `--batch` with `create-skill` to process multiple briefs at once. Progress is checkpointed — if interrupted, re-run `@Ferris CS --batch` and Ferris will resume automatically from where it left off.

### Stack Skills + Individual Skills

Stack skills focus on integration patterns. Individual skills focus on API surface. Use both together for maximum coverage.

### The Loop

After each sprint's refactor, run `@Ferris US` to regenerate changed components. Export updates your platform context files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursorrules) automatically. Skill generation becomes routine — like running tests.

### One Workflow Per Session

Clear your conversation context (start a new chat) before invoking a new workflow. Each SKF workflow loads step files, knowledge fragments, and extraction data into context. Starting fresh ensures the next workflow operates without interference from prior steps. Sidecar state (forge tier, preferences) persists automatically across sessions — you don't lose configuration.

### Full Control Over Scope

You can compile multiple skills from the same target (repo or docs) with different scopes and intents. Each brief defines what to extract and why, producing a distinct skill from the same source. For example, from a single library you could compile `cognee-core` for the public API, `cognee-graph-types` for the type system, and `cognee-migration` for upgrade patterns — each serving a different use case.

### Best Practices Built In

Generated skills automatically follow authoring best practices: third-person descriptions for reliable agent discovery, consistent terminology, degrees-of-freedom matching (prescriptive for fragile operations, flexible for creative tasks), and table-of-contents headers in large reference files. Discovery testing recommendations are included in test reports.

### Scripts & Assets

If your source repo includes executable scripts (`scripts/`, `bin/`) or static assets (`templates/`, `schemas/`), SKF detects and packages them automatically with provenance tracking. Custom scripts you add to `scripts/[MANUAL]/` are preserved during updates — just like `<!-- [MANUAL] -->` markers in SKILL.md.

### Let the Health Check Run

Every SKF workflow ends with a shared **health check** step where Ferris reflects on the session and offers to file friction, bugs, or gaps as GitHub issues (with your approval). Clean runs exit in one line — zero overhead. When something breaks, it's SKF's primary feedback channel, so **please let workflows run to completion**. If you had to cancel before the health check fired, ask Ferris to run it (`@Ferris please run the workflow health check for this session`) or [open an issue directly](https://github.com/armelhbobdad/bmad-module-skill-forge/issues/new/choose). See [Workflow Health Check](../workflows/#terminal-step-health-check) for details.
