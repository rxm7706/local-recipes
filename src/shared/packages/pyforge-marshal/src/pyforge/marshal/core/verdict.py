"""Sole owner of Marshal's verdict lattice + exit-code projection (Story
1.1, architecture spine AD-7/AD-31).

Lattice order (fixed, strongest first): ``error > gate-failed >
scope-violation > unevaluable > warn > clean`` (AD-7). Exit-code assignment
(recorded assumption, not architecture-dictated -- see the spec's Design
Notes: architecture pins only ``clean -> 0``, and PRD FR-19 requires "a
distinct code for could not evaluate"; neither source gives the other 3
numbers). Chosen, monotonic with lattice strength: ``warn=0`` (AD-31's own
reasoning for why ``warn`` is a distinct rung from ``unevaluable`` only
holds if ``warn`` exits 0, matching both ``pyforge-warden``'s and
``pyforge-doctor``'s existing exit-0 treatment of ``warn``),
``unevaluable=1``, ``scope-violation=2``, ``gate-failed=3``, ``error=4``.
``EXIT_SIGINT = 130``, ``EXIT_OK = 0``, and ``EXIT_USAGE = 2`` are
CLI-boundary constants, not lattice rungs; ``GUARDED_EXIT_CODES`` is the
computed frozen domain. AD-7 makes this module the only one permitted to
embed a literal from that domain -- every other module (the CLI included)
imports these names instead of spelling the integers.

``classify()`` is the SOLE owner of finding-code -> lattice-member
classification (AD-31): no other module assigns a verdict directly.
``_CLASSIFY_TABLE`` starts empty for the same reason ``findings.
REGISTERED_CODES`` starts empty (Design Notes) -- no command in this story
emits a real finding, so there is nothing to classify yet; later stories
populate it additively as they add real codes. The mechanism (a total,
fail-loud lookup) is proven via ``monkeypatch``-injected synthetic entries
in ``tests/unit/test_verdict.py``.

Every other module *feeds* findings; only this module *projects* them to a
verdict and an exit code -- enforced by the sole-ownership meta-test
(``tests/meta/test_ad7_verdict_sole_ownership.py``, adapted from
``pyforge-warden``'s sibling guard).
