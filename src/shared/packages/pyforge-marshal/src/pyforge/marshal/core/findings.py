"""The central finding-code registry (Story 1.1, architecture spine AD-15).

Every failure or warning Marshal ever emits carries a stable machine code
from this one registry, plus a human message (AD-15). Codes are never
reused or renumbered. Format: ``MRS-<AREA>-<NNN>`` (Consistency Conventions'
``Findings`` row) -- e.g. ``MRS-GATE-001``.

``REGISTERED_CODES`` starts an empty ``frozenset()`` (deliberate, Design
Notes): no command in this story emits a real finding -- ``marshal
--version``/``--help`` bypass the envelope entirely (mirrors
``pyforge-doctor``). Later stories append real codes here as they gain a
real caller. The registry MECHANISM (format check, then membership check)
is fully real and proven via ``monkeypatch``-injected synthetic codes in
``tests/unit/test_findings.py`` -- never via fabricated production codes.

This module is pure data: no I/O, no subprocess, no network, no clock
(AD-4).
