# Step 2: Detect Changes

## STEP GOAL:

Compare current source code state against the provenance map to produce a complete change manifest identifying every changed, added, deleted, moved, and renamed file and export since last extraction.

## Rules

- Focus only on detecting and classifying changes — do not extract or merge
- Use subprocess Pattern 4 (parallel) when available; if unavailable, compare sequentially

## Steps

### 0. Check for Test Report Input (Gap-Driven Mode)

**If `update_mode == "gap-driven"` (set in step 1 via `--from-test-report`):**

Load the test report at `{test_report_path}` and extract findings:

1. Read the **Gap Report** section — each gap entry has severity, category, and description
2. Read the **Coverage Analysis** section — each per-export row has documented/missing/mismatch status
3. Translate findings into change manifest format:

| Gap Severity | Gap Type | Change Category |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Critical | Missing export documentation | NEW_EXPORT (undocumented public API) — unless the remediation says the export is internal / out of scope; then DELETED_EXPORT (rescope), see rule R1 |
| High | Signature mismatch | MODIFIED_EXPORT (signature needs update) |
| Medium | Missing type/interface docs | NEW_EXPORT (undocumented type) |
| Medium | Stale documentation | MODIFIED_EXPORT (docs reference removed export) |
| Critical/Medium | Coverage gap whose remediation is **removal** (export is internal, `#[doc(hidden)]`, or explicitly out of scope) | DELETED_EXPORT (rescope) — see rule R1 |
| Medium/High | Structural / coherence drift (output file only, no source change) | STRUCTURAL_FIX — see rule R2 |
| Medium | Export documented in SKILL.md/references but **missing from the provenance-map** | NEW_EXPORT (provenance-completeness) — see rule R3 |
| Low | Missing metadata/examples | metadata update — see rule R4 |

**Translation rules (referenced by the table above):**

- **R1 — DELETED_EXPORT (rescope).** A coverage gap is a rescope only when its remediation text names removal (`rescope`, `remove from surface`, `out of scope`) or the export is upstream `#[doc(hidden)]` / internal. Default a bare "missing export documentation" gap to NEW_EXPORT (document it); choose rescope only on that explicit signal. **Interactive:** prompt per qualifying gap — "[D] Document the export / [R] Rescope (remove from the public surface)". **Headless:** default to **document** (NEW_EXPORT); choose rescope only when the remediation explicitly says removal *and* the export is internal/`#[doc(hidden)]`. A rescope is honest only if the reduction is expressed in the brief's scope: append a `scope.amendments[]` entry (`category: "scope-expansion"`, `action: "excluded"`) **and** add the export's source path to `brief.scope.exclude`, then route the entry to merge Priority 1 (removal) so step 4/6 remove it and recompute stats from the amended scope. Never close a coverage gap by editing `metadata.stats` to equal the documented count — that is denominator deflation and `skf-test-skill` will reject it.
- **R2 — STRUCTURAL_FIX.** A coherence finding from `skf-scan-skill-md-structure.py` (e.g., `table_drift`, `unbalanced_fences`, a broken intra-skill anchor) that touches the generated output file only, with no source change and no provenance entry change. Carries `remediation` text describing the surgical markdown edit. Routes to merge Priority 8 (generated-markdown edit only); it never adds, modifies, or removes a provenance `entries[]` row.
- **R3 — provenance-completeness.** An export documented in SKILL.md/`references/` but absent from the provenance-map. These are documented-and-known, so `unknown` is never correct: route to re-extract §0a source resolution **regardless of severity**, gated only on `source_root` being pinned and readable (see re-extract.md §0).
- **R4 — metadata update.** A metadata-coherence patch that changes no export's source (e.g., reconcile a divergent `stats` count). Routes to merge Priority 8b and is applied by write.md §2 *before* the automatic stat recount (see merge.md §3 / write.md §2).

4. Build the change manifest from translated gaps — no file-level timestamp comparison needed since source hasn't changed. For each manifest entry, propagate these fields from the test report finding so step 3 can resolve the export against live source:

   - **`severity`** — the Gap Report severity (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Info`). Step-03 §0 and step 6 §3 gate the null-citation fallback on severity: Critical/High gaps must produce AST provenance, Medium/Low/Info gaps may degrade to `unknown`.
   - **`source_citation: {file, line}`** — populated only when the finding's `Source:` field is a `file:line` pair (e.g., a Gap Report row that cites `packages/utils/src/builder-utils.ts:33`). Step-03 §0 uses this field to perform a live spot-check against source rather than flagging the export as `unknown`. Omit when the `Source:` field is a region reference (e.g., `@storybook/addon-docs control primitives`) or missing.
   - **`remediation_paths: [path, ...]`** — path-like tokens extracted from the finding's `Remediation:` text: any substring matching a recognized source file extension (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.py`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.java`, `.rb`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`), or a directory/glob fragment under the project's source root. Include every matching path verbatim. Step-03 §0a uses this list as the source set for its Targeted Re-Extraction Branch when `source_citation` is absent and severity is Critical/High. Omit the field when the Remediation text names no paths — the entry then falls through to `unknown` or to §0a's halt, depending on severity.
   - **`change_category`** — the Change Category resolved from the table above (`NEW_EXPORT`, `MODIFIED_EXPORT`, `DELETED_EXPORT`, `STRUCTURAL_FIX`, or `metadata update`). Step 3 §1a partitions on this field; merge.md §3 dispatches on it.
   - **`remediation`** — the finding's full `Remediation:` text, verbatim. Required for `STRUCTURAL_FIX` (the surgical markdown edit), `metadata update` (the patch description), and `DELETED_EXPORT` rescope (the removal rationale recorded in the `scope.amendments[]` entry). For `NEW_EXPORT` / `MODIFIED_EXPORT` it is informational.
   - **`provenance_completeness: true`** — set on a `NEW_EXPORT` entry whose gap is rule R3 (documented in SKILL.md/`references/` but absent from the provenance-map). Step 3 §0 routes these to §0a regardless of severity.
5. Set `gap_count` from the total number of translated entries
6. **Skip to section 5** (Display Change Summary) with the gap-derived manifest

"**Gap-driven update mode.** Translating {gap_count} test report findings into change manifest — source drift detection skipped."

**If normal mode:** Continue with source drift detection below.

### 1. Scan Current Source State

Read the source directory at `{source_root}` and build a current file inventory:
- For each source file: record path, file size, last modified timestamp
- Focus on file types relevant to the skill (from provenance map file patterns)
- Exclude non-source files (node_modules, build artifacts, etc.)

### 1b. Discovered Authoritative Files Protocol (Mirror)

**Purpose:** mirror `skf-create-skill` §2a into update-skill. `skf-create-skill` §2a catches authoritative AI documentation files (`llms.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.) during **creation**, but a project may add these files *after* the skill was created. Without this mirror, update-skill would either miss the new file entirely (if it doesn't match the provenance map's file patterns) or classify it as a generic ADDED file in §2 Category A with no authoritative-file treatment. The mirror surfaces the discovery with the same P/S/U prompt create-skill uses, honoring any prior amendments.

**Skip this section entirely if:**

- `update_mode == "gap-driven"` (source hasn't drifted — we're verifying test report findings, not discovering new files), OR
- `metadata.json.source_type == "docs-only"` (no source tree to scan)

**Procedure (identical heuristics to create-skill §2a):**

1. **Walk the source tree.** Match file basenames against the heuristic list case-insensitively:
   - `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`
   - `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `COPILOT.md`
   - `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`

2. **Cross-reference with provenance map.** For each match:
   - **Already in provenance map** (`entries[].source_file` or `file_entries[].source_file` contains this path): the file is already tracked. §2 will detect any drift in the normal flow. No action in §1b.
   - **Not in provenance map:** continue to amendment check.

3. **Check brief amendments.** Load `brief.scope.amendments[]` from `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml`. For each candidate not in the provenance map:
   - **`action: "promoted"` for this path exists:** the brief says this file should be in scope, but it's missing from the provenance map. This means the file was promoted by a prior run but its `file_entries[]` row is missing (e.g. provenance-map was regenerated from source without re-reading amendments). Add the path to `promoted_docs_new[]` (see step 6 below) with its content hash so §4 merge writes a new `file_entries[]` row. No user prompt — the decision was already made. Display: `"Honoring prior amendment: promoted {path} scheduled for file_entries write."`
   - **`action: "skipped"` for this path exists:** user previously declined promotion. Honor the skip silently. No prompt, no action.
   - **No amendment for this path:** continue to user prompt.

4. **Prompt.** For each unresolved candidate, present the same prompt as create-skill §2a:

   ```
   **New authoritative file discovered since skill creation**

   Path: {relative_path_from_source_root}
   Size: {line_count} lines, {bytes} bytes
   Matched heuristic: {basename}
   Provenance age: {days since skill creation}

   First 20 lines:
   {inline preview}

   This file was not present (or not in scope) when the skill was created. How should update-skill handle it?

   [P] Promote — extract in this update run AND amend brief for future runs
   [S] Skip    — leave out of scope AND record skip in amendments (no re-prompt)
   [U] Update  — halt this run and return to skf-brief-skill to refine scope
   ```

5. **Headless mode (`{headless_mode}` is true):** auto-select `[S] Skip` for every candidate — record `action: "skipped"`, `reason: "headless: no user to prompt"`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`. A non-interactive update run must never silently add files to scope. **Also append one entry per candidate to in-context `headless_decisions[]`** (surfaced via `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` by step 7): `{gate: "detect-changes.promoted-doc-prompt", default_action: "S", taken_action: "S", reason: "headless: no user to prompt", evidence: {path: "<candidate.path>"}}`.

6. **Apply decision:**

   - **[P] Promote:**
     1. Append `candidate.path` to `brief.scope.include` as a literal glob.
     2. Append a `brief.scope.amendments[]` entry: `action: "promoted"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided or auto: "discovered post-creation — matched heuristic {basename}"}`, `heuristic: {basename}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`.
     3. **Write the amended brief back to disk immediately** at `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml`. Preserve all other fields.
     4. **Hash the candidate** via `uv run {hashContentHelper} hash {candidate.path}` — emits `{content_hash, size_bytes, line_count}` as JSON. Combine with the existing context fields and append to the in-context `promoted_docs_new[]` list: `{path, heuristic, size_bytes, line_count, content_hash}`. This list is consumed by §4 merge Priority 7 to write new `file_entries[]` rows — promoted docs do NOT go through §3 code re-extraction, which would produce ghost entries on non-code files.
     5. Display: `"Promoted {path} — brief amended, scheduled as new file_entries row for file_type doc."`

   - **[S] Skip:**
     1. Do NOT modify `scope.include`.
     2. Append a `brief.scope.amendments[]` entry: `action: "skipped"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided or auto: "user declined promotion at update-skill §1b"}`, `heuristic: {basename}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`.
     3. **Write the amended brief back to disk** so neither update-skill nor create-skill will re-prompt in future runs.
     4. Display: `"Skipped {path} — decision recorded in amendments."`

   - **[U] Update:**
     1. Halt the workflow immediately.
     2. Display: `"Halting update-skill. Re-run skf-brief-skill to refine scope for {skill_name}, then re-run skf-update-skill."`
     3. Exit with status `halted-for-brief-refinement`. Change manifest is discarded — no partial writes.

7. **Summary.** After all candidates are resolved (or none were found):

   - `"Authoritative files mirror: {N} candidates, {P} promoted, {S} skipped, {A} pre-decided from amendments, {T} already tracked in provenance."`
   - If N = 0: `"Authoritative files mirror: no candidates."`

**Record for evidence report:** the update-skill evidence report appends `authoritative_files_mirror: {candidates: N, promoted: P, skipped: S, pre_decided: A, already_tracked: T, decisions: [{path, action, heuristic, reason}]}`.

**Interaction with §2 change detection:** promoted docs live in `promoted_docs_new[]`, not in the change manifest. §2.0's `change_detection_excludes` set (built below) is what stops §2 Category A from re-classifying them as ADDED — it is the only coordination that survives across the parallel Category A subprocesses.

### 1c. Major-Version Scope Reconciliation (Pre-Detection)

**Purpose:** §1b handles new authoritative-doc files; §1c handles new **code globs** that fall outside the original scope when upstream restructures (rebrand, package restructure, major-version rewrite) so the brief's `scope.include` no longer reflects the real public API. Without it, update-skill silently misses the new public surface and pays the gap cost on every future update.

**Skip this section entirely if:**

- `update_mode == "gap-driven"` (test-report mode — source hasn't drifted), OR
- `metadata.json.source_type == "docs-only"` (no source tree to scope), OR
- No audit drift report is available at the path computed in step 1 below.

**Procedure:**

1. **Discover, parse, and reconcile in one call.** The helper handles drift-report discovery (glob, timestamp-DESC sort, latest wins), Out-of-Scope section extraction (both `## Out-of-Scope Observations` and `### Out-of-Scope New Public API` under `## Remediation Suggestions` heading shapes), candidate parsing (bullet and table markdown formats), and amendment reconciliation against `brief.scope.amendments[]`:

   ```bash
   uv run {provenanceGapDispatchHelper} dispatch \
       --skill-name {skill_name} \
       --baseline-version {baseline_version} \
       --forge-data-folder {forge_data_folder} \
       --brief {forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml
   ```

   Output envelope:

   ```json
   {
     "status": "no-report" | "no-candidates" | "candidates-found",
     "report_path": "<abs path>" | null,
     "candidates_total": N,
     "classified": [
       {
         "path": "<glob or file path>",
         "evidence": "<one-liner>",
         "status": "already-in-scope" | "pre-decided-skipped"
                 | "pre-decided-demoted" | "unresolved",
         "prior_action": "promoted" | "skipped"
                       | "demoted-include" | "demoted-exclude"
                       | null
       }, ...
     ],
     "summary": {"pre_decided_count": N, "unresolved_count": N}
   }
   ```

2. **Dispatch on `status`:**

   - **`no-report`** — no drift report under `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/{baseline_version}/`. **Skip §1c entirely** — proceed to step 6's summary line (omit). §2.2's post-detection deletion-ratio trigger still catches major restructures.
   - **`no-candidates`** — report exists but the Out-of-Scope section is absent or empty. Proceed to step 6's summary line with `"no out-of-scope observations in drift report."`
   - **`candidates-found`** — iterate `classified[]`:
     - `status: "already-in-scope"` → skip silently (`prior_action: "promoted"`).
     - `status: "pre-decided-skipped"` → honor silently (`prior_action: "skipped"`).
     - `status: "pre-decided-demoted"` → record as `pre_decided`; do not re-prompt (`prior_action` ∈ `demoted-include`, `demoted-exclude`).
     - `status: "unresolved"` → continue to step 4 (user prompt).

   **Note:** the Out-of-Scope section is an optional audit-skill output and is often absent or empty — new-file detection is update-skill's job (§1b/§2.2), not audit-skill's — so the `no-report` / `no-candidates` paths above are the common case.

3. **Prompt for each unresolved candidate.** Present the same menu shape as §1b:

   ```
   **Out-of-scope new public API discovered**

   Path:          {candidate.path}
   Evidence:      {evidence from drift report}
   Drift report:  {report relative path}

   This path was not in the brief's `scope.include` when the skill was created. How should update-skill handle it?

   [P] Promote — add to scope.include AND extract in this run
   [S] Skip    — leave out of scope AND record skip in amendments (no re-prompt)
   [U] Update  — halt this run and return to skf-brief-skill to refine scope
   ```

4. **Headless mode (`{headless_mode}` is true):** auto-select `[S] Skip` for every candidate — record `action: "skipped"`, `category: "scope-expansion"`, `reason: "headless: no user to prompt"`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`. A non-interactive update run must never silently expand scope. **Also append one entry per candidate to in-context `headless_decisions[]`** (surfaced via `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` by step 7): `{gate: "detect-changes.scope-expansion", default_action: "S", taken_action: "S", reason: "headless: no user to prompt", evidence: {path: "<candidate.path>"}}`.

5. **Apply decision:**

   - **[P] Promote:**
     1. Append `candidate.path` to `brief.scope.include` as a literal glob (preserve any wildcards from the drift report).
     2. Append a `brief.scope.amendments[]` entry: `action: "promoted"`, `category: "scope-expansion"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided or auto: "out-of-scope new public API — drift report {report basename}"}`, `evidence: {evidence string}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`.
     3. **Write the amended brief back to disk immediately** at `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/skill-brief.yaml`. Preserve all other fields.
     4. Display: `"Promoted {path} — brief amended; §2 Category A will pick up matching files as ADDED."`
     5. **No `promoted_docs_new[]` entry and no `change_detection_excludes` write** — promoted code globs flow through the standard §2 Category A → §3 extraction path, unlike §1b's promoted docs which bypass extraction.

   - **[S] Skip:**
     1. Do NOT modify `scope.include` or `scope.exclude`.
     2. Append a `brief.scope.amendments[]` entry: `action: "skipped"`, `category: "scope-expansion"`, `path: candidate.path`, `reason: {user-provided or auto: "user declined promotion at update-skill §1c"}`, `evidence: {evidence string}`, `date: {today ISO}`, `workflow: "skf-update-skill"`.
     3. **Write the amended brief back to disk** so neither §1c nor a future run will re-prompt.
     4. Display: `"Skipped {path} — decision recorded in amendments."`

   - **[U] Update:**
     1. Halt the workflow immediately.
     2. Display: `"Halting update-skill. Re-run skf-brief-skill to refine scope for {skill_name}, then re-run skf-update-skill."`
     3. Exit with status `halted-for-brief-refinement`. Change manifest is not yet built — no partial writes to provenance.

6. **Summary:** After all candidates are resolved (or none were found):

   - `"Scope reconciliation: {N} candidates, {P} promoted, {S} skipped, {A} pre-decided from amendments."`
   - If N = 0 (section absent or empty): `"Scope reconciliation: no out-of-scope observations in drift report."`
   - If §1c was skipped entirely (no drift report): omit this line; §2.2 will still run.

**Record for evidence report:** the update-skill evidence report appends `scope_reconciliation_pre: {drift_report: path, candidates: N, promoted: P, skipped: S, pre_decided: A, decisions: [{path, action, evidence}]}` (omit when §1c was skipped).

### 2. Compare Against Provenance Map

**If normal mode (provenance map available):**

#### 2.0 — Build Pre-filter Exclusion Set

Before launching parallel subprocesses, build a `change_detection_excludes` set in context that Category A subprocess workers must honor. Parallel subprocesses cannot see each other's in-memory state, so any coordination between §1b's decisions and §2's scan results must be pre-materialized into an explicit input the subprocesses receive.

The exclusion set includes:

- Every path in `promoted_docs_new[]` (populated by §1b). These files are tracked as `file_entries[]` via step 4 Priority 7, not through Category A code extraction. Without this exclusion, Category A would classify them as ADDED (because they're in source but not yet in the provenance map) and §3 re-extract would send them to AST extraction, producing ghost entries.
- Every source path in `file_entries[].source_file` where `file_type == "doc"` in the existing provenance map. These are already-tracked authoritative docs; any drift in them is handled by Category D (script/asset file changes), not Category A.

Record the set size: "**Change-detection excludes:** {count} paths ({promoted_docs_new count} new promotions + {existing doc file_entries count} already tracked)."

#### 2.1 — Launch Category Subprocesses

Launch subprocesses in parallel that compare source state against provenance map across these categories, returning change findings per category. **Every subprocess receives `change_detection_excludes` as an explicit input** and applies it to its file-path iteration loop.

**Category A — File-level changes:**
- Files in provenance map but missing from source → DELETED
- Files in source but not in provenance map AND not in `change_detection_excludes` → ADDED
- Files in `change_detection_excludes`: skip entirely (routed to file_entries via §1b → step 4 Priority 7, never through Category A)
- Files in both but with different timestamps/sizes → MODIFIED
- Files with same content at different paths → MOVED

**Category B — Export-level changes (for MODIFIED files only):**
- For each modified file, compare export list against provenance map exports
- Exports in provenance but not in source → DELETED_EXPORT
- Exports in source but not in provenance → NEW_EXPORT
- Exports with changed signatures/types → MODIFIED_EXPORT
- Exports at different line numbers but same content → MOVED_EXPORT

**Category C — Rename detection:**
- Cross-reference deleted files/exports with added files/exports
- If content similarity > 80% (fixed bundled threshold — not configurable): classify as RENAMED instead of deleted+added. **Similarity mechanism by tier:** Quick: compare file size ratio (within 20%) and export name overlap (>70% of exports match by name). Forge and above: use ast-grep to compare export signatures between the deleted and added files. Forge+/Deep: use CCC semantic similarity when available

**Subprocess return contract.** Hand each Category worker its exact output slice so it returns parse-ready JSON, not prose the parent must re-read. Each worker returns ONLY its own object — no prose, no commentary, no markdown fences (parent strips wrapping fences before parsing). The slice each worker fills is exactly the key §3's `build` helper consumes (the `category_a/b/c` shape below; Category D is helper-driven, not a worker):

```json
// Category A worker returns ONLY:
{"category_a": {"modified": [...], "added": [...], "deleted": [...]}}
// Category B worker returns ONLY:
{"category_b": {"modified_exports": [...], "new_exports": [...], "deleted_exports": [...], "moved_exports": [...]}}
// Category C worker returns ONLY:
{"category_c": {"renamed_files": [...], "renamed_exports": [...]}}
```

The parent merges the three slices (plus Category D and the `degraded_mode`/`update_mode` flags) into the single category-JSON object §3 pipes to the `build` helper.

**Category D — Script/asset file changes:**

Run the bulk comparison once via:

```bash
uv run {hashContentHelper} compare <source-root> \
    --provenance-map <provenance-map-path>
```

The helper emits:

```json
{
  "comparisons": [
    {"source_file": "...", "classification": "UNCHANGED|MODIFIED_FILE|DELETED_FILE",
     "stored_hash": "sha256:...", "current_hash": "sha256:..."|null,
     "current_size_bytes": N|null}, ...
  ],
  "stats": {"total": N, "unchanged": U, "modified": M, "deleted": D}
}
```

Translate the helper's output into the change manifest:
- `MODIFIED_FILE` rows → add to manifest as MODIFIED_FILE
- `DELETED_FILE` rows → add to manifest as DELETED_FILE
- `UNCHANGED` rows → omit from the manifest (no action needed)

The compare helper reports only tracked files; NEW_FILE detection (a file present in source but absent from the provenance map) is a set-difference, so it runs through a script rather than the prompt. Pipe the same deterministic detector create-skill step 3 §4c uses (resolved via `detectScriptsAssetsProbeOrder`) into `{newFileDiffHelper}`, which subtracts the provenance map's `file_entries[].source_file` and sets aside user-authored `[MANUAL]` paths:

```bash
uv run {detectScriptsAssetsHelper} detect <source-root> \
    | uv run {newFileDiffHelper} {forge_version}/provenance-map.json
```

It emits `{"new_files":[{source_file, kind}], "skipped_manual":[...], "already_tracked":[...], "stats":{...}}`. Add each `new_files[]` entry to the manifest as NEW_FILE — `kind` (`script`/`asset`) selects the target array. `skipped_manual[]` are user-authored files under `scripts/[MANUAL]/` or `assets/[MANUAL]/`, preserved and not touched; `already_tracked[]` were handled by the compare above.

Aggregate all subprocess results into a unified change manifest.

**If degraded mode (no provenance map):**
- All source files are treated as MODIFIED
- All exports will be fully re-extracted in step 03
- Skip export-level comparison

#### 2.2 — Major-Version Scope Reconciliation (Post-Detection)

**Purpose:** §1c catches the major-version case when an audit drift report supplies explicit candidates. §2.2 is the safety net that fires when no audit was run (or audit emitted no out-of-scope section): it inspects the just-built Category A/B results for the deletion-ratio signature of a major-version restructure and gives the user an off-ramp before §3 commits the change manifest.

**Trigger computation:** invoke the helper with the same Category A/B/C/D JSON used for §3, plus the provenance map:

```bash
echo "{category JSON}" | uv run {buildChangeManifestHelper} deletion-ratio \
    --provenance-map {forge_version}/provenance-map.json
```

The helper handles the three skip conditions internally — when the input has `update_mode: "gap-driven"`, `degraded_mode: true`, or the provenance has zero entries, it returns `skip_reason` set and `should_trigger: false`. `should_trigger` fires when the deletion ratio reaches the fixed bundled threshold of 50% (`ratio >= 0.50`, baked into the helper — not configurable). The output envelope:

```json
{
  "skip_reason": "gap-driven" | "degraded-mode" | "zero-provenance-exports" | null,
  "deleted_export_count": N,
  "total_provenance_exports": N,
  "deletion_ratio": 0.X,
  "deleted_file_count": N,
  "added_in_scope_count": N,
  "renamed_or_moved_count": N,
  "should_trigger": <bool>
}
```

If `skip_reason` is non-null OR `should_trigger` is false, skip the prompt and continue to §3. If `should_trigger` is true, present the prompt below.

**Prompt:**

```
**Major-version scope shift detected**

Deleted exports:        {deleted_export_count} of {total_provenance_exports} ({percent}%)
Deleted files:          {deleted_file_count}
Added files (in scope): {added_in_scope_count}
Renamed/moved exports:  {renamed_or_moved_count}

The upstream surface appears to have been substantially replaced. The brief's
`scope.include` patterns may no longer reflect the real public API.

[C] Continue — proceed with re-extraction; the deletion is intentional
[B] Brief    — halt and re-run skf-brief-skill to refine scope first
[A] Audit    — halt and run skf-audit-skill to map the new surface, then re-run update-skill
```

**Headless mode (`{headless_mode}` is true):** auto-select `[C] Continue`, log a WARN-level entry to the evidence report (`scope_reconciliation_post: {trigger: "deletion-ratio", ratio: X, decision: "headless-continue"}`), and surface the warning in step 7's report. A non-interactive run must not silently halt, but the user must be able to see the signal post-hoc. **Also append to in-context `headless_decisions[]`** (surfaced via `SKF_UPDATE_RESULT_JSON` by step 7): `{gate: "detect-changes.deletion-ratio", default_action: "C", taken_action: "C", reason: "headless: deletion-ratio threshold exceeded but no user to halt", evidence: {deletion_ratio: <ratio>, deleted_export_count: <N>, total_provenance_exports: <T>}}`.

**Apply decision:**

- **[C] Continue:** record `scope_reconciliation_post: {trigger: "deletion-ratio", ratio: X, decision: "continue"}` and proceed to §3.
- **[B] Brief:** halt with status `halted-for-brief-refinement`. Display: `"Halting update-skill. Re-run skf-brief-skill to refine scope for {skill_name}, then re-run skf-update-skill."` Change manifest discarded — no partial writes.
- **[A] Audit:** halt with status `halted-for-audit`. Display: `"Halting update-skill. Run skf-audit-skill against {skill_name} to map the new surface — its drift report will feed §1c on the next update-skill run."` Change manifest discarded.

### 3. Build Change Manifest

Hand the assembled Category A/B/C/D JSON to the helper:

```bash
echo "{category JSON}" | uv run {buildChangeManifestHelper} build
```

The category JSON shape is:

```json
{
  "category_a": {"modified": [...], "added": [...], "deleted": [...]},
  "category_b": {"modified_exports": [...], "new_exports": [...],
                 "deleted_exports": [...], "moved_exports": [...]},
  "category_c": {"renamed_files": [...], "renamed_exports": [...]},
  "category_d": {"scripts_modified": [...], "scripts_added": [...],
                 "scripts_deleted": [...], "assets_modified": [...],
                 "assets_added": [...], "assets_deleted": [...]},
  "degraded_mode": <bool>,
  "update_mode": "normal" | "gap-driven"
}
```

The helper emits the unified manifest envelope:

```json
{
  "no_changes": <bool>,
  "degraded_mode": <bool>,
  "counts": {
    "files_changed": N, "files_added": N, "files_deleted": N, "files_moved": N,
    "exports_modified": N, "exports_new": N, "exports_deleted": N,
    "exports_renamed": N, "exports_moved": N,
    "scripts_modified": N, "scripts_added": N, "scripts_deleted": N,
    "assets_modified": N, "assets_added": N, "assets_deleted": N
  },
  "total_export_changes": N,
  "per_file": [
    {"file_path": "...", "status": "MODIFIED|ADDED|DELETED|MOVED",
     "exports_affected": [{name, change_type, old_line, new_line}, ...]}
  ]
}
```

`per_file` entries are sorted MODIFIED → ADDED → DELETED → MOVED, then alphabetically within each status group, so downstream stages can rely on stable ordering. MOVED entries include an extra `old_path` field. Stash the envelope as the change manifest in workflow context.

### 4. Check for No-Change Shortcut

**If zero changes detected across all categories:**

"**No changes detected.** Source code matches provenance map exactly.

The skill `{skill_name}` is current — no update needed.

**Skipping to report step...**"

→ Skip steps 03-06, immediately load {noChangeReportFile} with "no changes" status.

### 5. Display Change Summary and Route

"**Change Detection Complete:**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Files modified | {count} |
| Files added | {count} |
| Files deleted | {count} |
| Files moved/renamed | {count} |
| Exports affected | {total_export_changes} |"

This step auto-proceeds — no user choices. Once the change manifest is fully built, load and fully read the next file, then execute it, per the branch that applies:

- **`detect_only_mode == true`** → display "**Detect-only mode — skipping re-extract/merge/validate/write.** Loading report..." and load `{noChangeReportFile}` (report.md), which emits status `detect-only`. Do not load `{nextStepFile}`.
- **No changes detected** (section 4) → load `{noChangeReportFile}` (report.md), which emits status `no-changes`.
- **Otherwise** → display "**Proceeding to re-extraction of {affected_file_count if normal mode, or gap_count if gap-driven mode} changes...**" and load `{nextStepFile}` (re-extract.md) to begin re-extraction.
