# Step 3: Re-Extract Changed Exports

## STEP GOAL:

Perform tier-aware extraction on only the changed files identified in step 02, producing fresh export data with confidence tier labels (T1/T1-low/T2) that will be merged into the existing skill in step 04.

## Rules

- Focus only on extracting changed exports — do not merge or modify existing skill
- Only extract files in the change manifest — do not touch unchanged files. **Exception (gap-driven mode):** §0a's Targeted Re-Extraction Branch also scans files listed in each manifest entry's `remediation_paths[]` to resolve citation-less Critical/High gaps.
- For each changed file, launch a subprocess for deep AST analysis (Pattern 2); if unavailable, extract sequentially

## Steps

### 0. Check for Gap-Driven Mode

**If `update_mode == "gap-driven"` (set in step 1 via `--from-test-report`, confirmed in step 2 section 0):**

Source code has not drifted — the gap-derived manifest from step 2 contains export-level findings translated from the test report, not file-level changes. Perform citation spot-checks instead of full re-extraction to verify each gap-affected export is still at its recorded location.

**0.a Pre-flight: verify workspace HEAD matches pinned commit.** Gap-driven spot-checks read source at recorded `source_line` positions and must see the exact bytes the skill was pinned against. A drifted workspace silently verifies against the wrong tree — moved/renamed symbols appear "verified" because the recorded line now points at different code. Before reading any source, run the guard via `{checkWorkspaceDriftHelper}`:

```bash
uv run {checkWorkspaceDriftHelper} <source-root> \
    --pinned-commit "<metadata.source_commit>" \
    [--source-ref "<metadata.source_ref>"] \
    [--allow-drift]
```

Pass `--allow-drift` only when the user provided `--allow-workspace-drift` to update-skill. The helper accepts `""` and `"local"` as the "no pinned commit" sentinels; it also auto-skips when `source_root` is not a git working tree (bare checkout, tarball extract, etc.).

The helper emits a result envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "ok" | "skipped" | "mismatch" | "overridden",
  "skip_reason": "no-pinned-commit" | "not-a-git-tree" | null,
  "head_sha": "...", "head_short_sha": "...", "match_kind": "full" | "short-prefix" | null,
  "log_message": "workspace_drift_check: ...",
  "halt_message": "<multi-line user-facing message>" | null
}
```

**Dispatch on `status`:**

- **`ok` or `skipped`** (helper exit 0): log `log_message` and continue to bullet 1.
- **`overridden`** (helper exit 0): log `log_message`, surface a visible warning in the final report ("**Workspace drift accepted via --allow-workspace-drift** — spot-checks read HEAD {head_short_sha}, not pinned {pinned_commit}"), and continue to bullet 1. The override does not automatically re-pin `metadata.source_commit`; re-pinning is explicit user work (run the normal-mode update-skill flow against the same HEAD, or re-create the skill).
- **`mismatch`** (helper exit 2): HALT immediately with status `halted-for-workspace-drift`. Display the helper's `halt_message` verbatim — it already substitutes `{pinned_commit}`, `{source_ref or "unset"}`, `{source_root}`, `{head_sha}`, and the suggested `git checkout` command. Do not proceed to bullet 1. Step-04 merge has not run; no partial writes. In `{headless_mode}`, emit the halt envelope per SKILL.md §Headless (`error: {phase: "re-extract:workspace-drift", path: "{source_root}", reason: "..."}`).

1. Use the provenance map already loaded in step 1 (at `{forge_version}/provenance-map.json`) — do not re-read
2. **Partition by change category, then iterate the export-bearing entries.** Entries that do not name an export skip the per-export verification below — they have no symbol to resolve against source:
   - **`STRUCTURAL_FIX`** (detect-changes §0 rule R2): forward verbatim to the merge step (its `remediation` text describes a generated-markdown edit). No spot-check, no provenance lookup, no `entries[]` change.
   - **`metadata update`** (rule R4): forward the metadata-patch payload to the merge step. No spot-check, no provenance lookup.

   Carry both through workflow context to merge.md unchanged. Then, for each export-bearing entry (`NEW_EXPORT`, `MODIFIED_EXPORT`, `DELETED_EXPORT`):
   - **If the entry is `DELETED_EXPORT` (rescope, rule R1):** do not resolve against source — the export is being removed from the public surface. Record `verification: rescoped` and flag for merge Priority 1 (removal). Confirm the brief carries the matching `scope.amendments[]` (`action: "excluded"`) + `scope.exclude` entry that step 2 R1 wrote; if absent, HALT — a rescope without a brief scope amendment is denominator deflation and must not be written.
   - Look up the export by `name` in `provenance_map.exports` — read `source_file` and `source_line`
   - **If export not found in provenance map:**
     - **If the manifest entry has a `source_citation` (propagated from the test report by step 2 §0 bullet 4):** read the file at that citation's `file:line ± 5` lines and verify the symbol name still appears within that window. Record a full `verified` / `moved` / `missing` entry using the citation as the starting location — same spot-check logic as the "export found" branch below, keyed on the manifest-supplied citation instead of the provenance map. The export is still flagged `NEW_EXPORT` for the merge step; this branch only upgrades the provenance entry from `unknown` to a live spot-check result so step 6 writes `source_file` / `source_line` instead of `null`.
     - **If the entry is a provenance-completeness gap (rule R3 — documented in SKILL.md/`references/` but missing from the provenance-map) AND `source_root` is pinned and readable:** route this entry to §0a (Targeted Re-Extraction Branch) **regardless of severity**. These exports are documented-and-known; `unknown` is never the correct outcome for them. §0a resolves them against pinned source and records a full `re-extracted` provenance entry. This route takes precedence over the severity-gated branches below.
     - **If the manifest entry has no `source_citation` but has a non-empty `remediation_paths[]` AND `severity` is `Critical` or `High`:** route this entry to §0a (Targeted Re-Extraction Branch). §0a scans the remediation paths with the tier-appropriate extractor and, on success, records a full verification record with `verification: re-extracted`, a live `provenance_citation`, and full signature/params/return-type fields for the merge step to consume as a NEW_EXPORT. On failure, §0a halts the workflow — Critical/High gaps are not allowed to degrade to `unknown`. See §0a for the procedure, the consolidated halt protocol, and the output record shape.
     - **If the manifest entry has no `source_citation` AND (`remediation_paths[]` is empty OR `severity` is `Medium`, `Low`, or `Info`) AND it is not a provenance-completeness gap:** record as new (`provenance_citation: unknown`) — no spot-check possible; flag for merge step to handle as `NEW_EXPORT`. Step-06 §3 only accepts null `source_file` / `source_line` for these lower-severity unknowns; a Critical/High unknown reaching step 6 indicates §0a was skipped or bypassed and is a workflow bug.
   - **If export found:** read the source file at `source_line ± 5` lines and verify the symbol name still appears within that window
   - Record verification outcome: `verified` (symbol at recorded line), `moved` (symbol found elsewhere in same file — record new line), `missing` (symbol not found in file), `re-extracted` (resolved via §0a from `remediation_paths[]` or rule R3), `rescoped` (DELETED_EXPORT — flagged for removal), or `unknown` (no usable provenance data)
   - **Public-reachability gate (`NEW_EXPORT` only):** before an entry is flagged `NEW_EXPORT` for the merge step, confirm the symbol is reachable as **public API** — not merely that a `pub` / `export` / top-level definition exists at the citation. The spot-check already read `source_file` at `source_line ± 5`; extend that read to resolve the symbol's module path and confirm at least one of: (a) it is re-exported from the package entry-point barrel (`lib.rs` `pub use`, `index.ts` / `index.js` export, `__init__.py` import or `__all__`), or (b) every ancestor module on the path from that barrel is public (Rust `pub mod`, an exported TS namespace, a non-underscore Python package). A `pub(crate)` / `pub(super)` item, or one under a private module (e.g. `mod authority;` declared without `pub`), is **not** reachable. **On failure:** do not document it as public — drop it from the export-bearing set so it is never written to the documented `exports[]` array or SKILL.md, and re-queue it as a `metadata update` (rule R4) recording `reclassified: internal-unreachable` for the evidence report. Do **not** hand-set any `stats` count: write.md §2's automatic recount derives `exports_internal` / `exports_total` from the merged surface and owns those fields. This honors the workflow rule that documented API must be importable by users — a `pub`-but-internal symbol would otherwise inflate the documented public surface with a type users cannot import.
3. Build a minimal extraction results block matching section 4's shape, with `mode: gap-driven` and per-export verification records:

   ```
   Extraction Results:
     mode: gap-driven
     files_extracted: {count}  # non-zero only when §0a scanned remediation_paths[]
     exports_extracted: {gap_count}
     confidence_breakdown:
       T1: {verified_count + moved_count + re_extracted_t1_count}
       T1-low: {re_extracted_t1_low_count}
       T2: 0

     Per-export verification:
       {export_name}:
         provenance_citation: {source_file}:{source_line}
         verification: verified|moved|missing|unknown|re-extracted|rescoped
         new_location: {source_file}:{new_line}  # set when moved OR re-extracted
         resolution_source: remediation-paths    # set only when verification == re-extracted
         gap_category: NEW_EXPORT|MODIFIED_EXPORT|DELETED_EXPORT|metadata_update

     Per-file extractions:   # populated only when §0a produced re-extracted records
       {file_path}:
         exports:
           - name: {export_name}
             type: function|class|type|constant
             signature: {full signature}
             location: {file}:{start_line}-{end_line}
             confidence: T1|T1-low
             params: [{name, type}]
             return_type: {type}
             docstring: {summary}
   ```

4. Set `no_reextraction: true` in workflow context — step 6 will use this flag to skip stale `source_file`/`source_line`/`confidence` field updates for `verified` exports. `moved` exports get updated citations; `re-extracted` exports get full fresh provenance from §0a's extraction records (see step 6 §3). The flag is a global gap-driven marker, not a per-entry one — step 6 dispatches on each verification outcome independently.
5. **Skip all remaining sections of step 3** — sections 1–5 are source-drift extraction paths that do not apply. Display the summary below and load `{nextStepFile}` to proceed directly to the merge step.

"**Gap-driven re-extraction.** Verified {verified_count}/{gap_count} citations against live source. Moved: {moved_count}. Missing: {missing_count}. Re-extracted (via remediation paths or provenance-completeness, §0a): {re_extracted_count}. Rescoped (removed from surface): {rescoped_count}. Unknown (not in provenance map): {unknown_count}. Proceeding to merge."

**If normal mode (`update_mode` unset or not `gap-driven`):** Continue with docs-only check and source extraction below.

### 0a. Targeted Re-Extraction Branch (Helper — Called from §0 bullet 2)

**Do not execute this section sequentially.** It is a helper procedure invoked by §0 bullet 2 when specific conditions are met (see below). Normal-mode runs, and gap-driven runs where every entry has a `source_citation` or qualifies as `Medium`/`Low`/`Info` unknown, skip this section entirely. §0's "skip sections 1–5" instruction does not apply here — §0a is addressed by name from §0, not by sequential fall-through.

**Used by:** §0 bullet 2, in either of two cases:

- a manifest entry has no `source_citation`, has non-empty `remediation_paths[]`, and `severity` is `Critical` or `High`; **or**
- a provenance-completeness gap (rule R3 — documented but missing from the provenance-map), routed here **regardless of severity** as long as `source_root` is pinned and readable. For this case, treat the export's documented `source` reference (or `remediation_paths[]` when present) as the path set to scan.

**Purpose:** produce AST-backed provenance for citation-less Critical/High gaps so step 6 §3 never writes `source_file: null` for blocking findings. Honors the workflow-level rule **Never hallucinate — every statement must have AST provenance** against the most common gap-driven trigger — a failing test report whose Gap Report `Source:` field is a region reference (e.g., `@storybook/addon-docs control primitives`) rather than a `file:line` pair. Gap-driven mode skips §1 through §5, so §0a is also the only place §1b's source-access and extraction machinery is invoked during gap-driven runs.

**Procedure:**

1. **Resolve source access** — invoke §1b's MCP-fallback chain (gh API → zread → deepwiki → workspace / ephemeral clone) once per workflow run to ensure files under `{source_root}` are readable. Cache the chosen access path; do not re-resolve per entry.
2. **Expand `remediation_paths[]`** — for each path across all qualifying entries:
   - Literal source file (ends in a recognized source extension): use as-is.
   - Directory or glob: expand under `{source_root}` using the provenance map's file patterns.
   - **Security boundary:** reject and skip any path that resolves outside `{source_root}`. Remediation text is user-editable and must never be allowed to escape the source tree.
   - Deduplicate the resolved file set across all entries routed to §0a — each physical file is scanned at most once.
3. **Extract** — run the tier-appropriate extractor from §1b (Quick pattern-match → T1-low; Forge/Forge+/Deep AST via ast-grep → T1) over the resolved file set. Launch subprocesses in parallel (Pattern 4) when available; sequential fallback otherwise. Follow the AST Extraction Protocol in `{extractionPatternsData}` for Forge/Deep tiers, and the tier-degradation rules in `{tierDegradationRulesData}` when AST tools fail on individual files.
4. **Match by name** — for each manifest entry routed here, search the aggregated extraction results for an export whose `name` matches the manifest entry's `name`. Record the first hit as:
   - `verification: re-extracted`
   - `provenance_citation: {file}:{start_line}` from the AST result
   - `new_location: {file}:{start_line}` (same value — satisfies the existing consumer contract)
   - `resolution_source: remediation-paths`
   - `confidence: T1` (AST-extracted) or `T1-low` (pattern-matched fallback)
   - the full extraction signature (type, params, return_type, docstring) — mirror the shape of §4's per-file extraction record so step 4 Priority 5 can merge it with the same code path used in normal mode.

   Then apply the §0 bullet 2 **public-reachability gate** to each matched symbol before recording it as a NEW_EXPORT: §0a has full source access, so resolve the symbol's module path and confirm barrel re-export or a fully-`pub` module chain. If it is unreachable (`pub(crate)` / private module), do **not** record `re-extracted` — drop it from the export-bearing set and re-queue the entry as a `metadata update` (rule R4, `reclassified: internal-unreachable`), exactly as the gate specifies. A re-extracted symbol that is not public API is not a documentable NEW_EXPORT. This is a resolution, not an `unresolved[]` failure (step 5) — the symbol was found, just not public — so it does not trigger the Critical/High HALT.
5. **Track failures across all qualifying entries.** Collect every entry whose symbol was not found in any scanned remediation path into an `unresolved[]` list. After processing every qualifying entry, if `unresolved[]` is non-empty: HALT with a consolidated report listing every unresolved entry (`name`, `severity`, `remediation_paths`, `files_scanned`, `exports_found_in_scan`). Template:

   ```
   Targeted re-extraction failed for {N} Critical/High gap(s).

   Critical and High gaps must resolve to AST provenance. The Remediation text for
   the entries below does not name a file that contains the expected export, so the
   workflow cannot produce a non-null `source_file` / `source_line` without
   hallucinating.

   Unresolved entries:
     {for each entry in unresolved[]:}
       - {name} ({severity})
         remediation_paths: {paths}
         files_scanned:     {count}
         exports_matched:   0

   Fix one of the following, then re-run update-skill:
     a) Add a `file:line` citation to the Gap Report `Source:` field.
     b) Edit the Remediation text to name the file(s) that actually contain the export(s).
     c) Downgrade the gap(s) to Medium/Low/Info (accepts the degraded documentation outcome).
   ```

   Exit with status `halted-for-remediation-path`. Step-04 merge has not run; no partial writes. In `{headless_mode}`, emit the halt envelope per SKILL.md §Headless (`error: {phase: "re-extract:targeted-reextraction", reason: "..."}`).

6. **Success summary** — record `targeted_reextraction: {resolved_count, files_scanned, exports_matched, tier}` in workflow context. The evidence report (step 6 §4) surfaces this alongside the verified / moved / missing tally.

**Why halt instead of degrading to `unknown`:** a Critical or High gap by definition blocks skill usefulness — it is either missing documentation for a public API or a wrong signature. Silently writing `source_file: null` for a blocking gap produces a skill that passes re-test but still hides the broken behavior behind a placeholder. The halt forces the test report to carry usable remediation information — a one-time fix-up that is far cheaper than a downstream audit trying to track why the "repaired" skill still fails.

### 1. Check for Docs-Only Mode

**If `source_type: "docs-only"` in the original brief or metadata:**

"**Docs-only skill detected.** This skill was generated from external documentation, not source code. Re-extraction will re-fetch the original `doc_urls` to check for updated content."

- Re-fetch each URL from `doc_urls` (from the brief or metadata) using whatever web fetching capability is available
- Extract updated API information with T3 `[EXT:{url}]` citations
- Build the updated extraction inventory from fetched content
- Skip all source code extraction below — proceed directly to the merge step (section 5 or equivalent)

**If `source_type: "source"` (default):** Continue with source extraction below.

### 1b. Determine Extraction Strategy by Tier

**Remote Source Resolution (Forge/Deep only):**

**MCP source access (ordered fallback):** When `source_repo` is set in metadata.json, try each MCP tool in order to fetch only the changed files from the change manifest. This avoids clone overhead entirely. Tools are ordered by data freshness — gh API returns live GitHub content and is preferred for update-skill where current file versions are required. zread and deepwiki depend on manual indexing and may return stale data if indexes haven't been refreshed since the changes being extracted.

1. **gh API** — `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` for raw file content
   - If accessible: fetch file content (base64-decoded), always current
   - If rate-limited, 404, or inaccessible: log tool and reason, continue to next tool
2. **zread** — `get_repo_structure` + `read_file` for targeted file access
   - If repo found: fetch changed files, proceed with extraction
   - If "repo not found" or error: log tool and reason, continue to next tool
   - Caveat: indexed data — may be stale if index wasn't refreshed after the target changes
3. **deepwiki** — `ask_question` for targeted export/signature queries
   - If repo indexed and returns usable source data: extract from response
   - If no results or repo not indexed: log tool and reason, continue to next tool
   - Caveat: returns synthesized content, not raw source — extraction quality varies; index may be stale

**Confidence labeling:** MCP-fetched content written to a temp file and analyzed with ast-grep → T1. MCP-fetched content analyzed with pattern matching (AST unavailable) → T1-low.

**If all MCP tools fail for this repo:** Fall back to workspace or ephemeral clone — load and follow `{remoteSourceResolutionData}` for clone setup, version reconciliation, and AST tool unavailability handling.

**If all approaches fail (MCP + workspace/ephemeral clone):** Degrade to provenance-map-only analysis (State 2, T1 confidence from compilation-time data). Warn user: "Source access failed for {source_repo}. Analysis limited to provenance-map baseline."

**Quick tier (text pattern matching):**
- Extract function/class/type names via regex patterns
- Extract export statements via text matching
- Confidence: T1-low (pattern-matched, not AST-verified)

**Forge tier (AST structural extraction):**

Load and follow the **AST Extraction Protocol** from `{extractionPatternsData}`. Use the decision tree based on the number of changed files: prefer MCP `find_code()` for small sets, `find_code_by_rule()` with scoped YAML rules for medium sets, and CLI `--json=stream` with line-by-line streaming for large sets. Never use `ast-grep --json` (without `=stream`) — it loads the entire result set into memory and will fail on large codebases.

- Extract: function signatures, type definitions, class members, exported constants
- Extract: parameter types, return types, JSDoc/docstring comments
- Confidence: T1 (AST-verified structural truth)

**Tier degradation handling (Forge/Forge+/Deep):** If ast-grep is unavailable or fails on individual files, follow `{tierDegradationRulesData}` for fallback strategy and user notification requirements. Silent degradation is forbidden — the user must always know when AST extraction was skipped.

**Deep tier (AST + QMD semantic enrichment):**
- Perform all Forge tier extractions (T1)
- Additionally: launch a subprocess that queries qmd_bridge for temporal context on changed exports, returning T2 evidence per export
- QMD provides: usage patterns, historical context, related documentation
- Confidence: T1 for structural, T2 for semantic enrichment

**Tool resolution:** `ast_bridge` → ast-grep MCP tools (`find_code`, `find_code_by_rule`) or `ast-grep` CLI. `qmd_bridge` → QMD MCP tools (`mcp__plugin_qmd-plugin_qmd__search`, `vector_search`) or `qmd` CLI. See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

### 2. Extract Changed Files

**Skip authoritative doc paths.** Before iterating the change manifest, build a skip set from `promoted_docs_new[]` (populated by step 2 §1b) and any existing `file_entries[]` entries with `file_type: "doc"` from the provenance map. These are documentation files tracked for drift detection only — they must not reach AST extraction, which would produce ghost entries on non-code content. If a change manifest entry matches the skip set, skip it silently and continue; doc-type drift is handled by step 2 Category D and step 4 Priority 6/7.

For each remaining file in the change manifest with status MODIFIED, ADDED, or RENAMED, launch a subprocess that:

1. Loads the source file
2. Performs tier-appropriate extraction (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep)
3. Extract each export into the per-file return contract shown in bullet 4.
4. **Return contract.** Each extraction worker returns ONLY this per-file block — no prose, no commentary, no markdown fences (the parent strips wrapping fences before parsing). The shape is exactly the per-file record §4 aggregates (the `Per-file extractions` block, lines below), so the parent appends it verbatim rather than re-parsing free text:

   ```json
   {
     "file_path": "...",
     "exports": [
       {"name": "...", "type": "function|class|type|constant",
        "signature": "...", "location": "{file}:{start_line}-{end_line}",
        "confidence": "T1|T1-low|T2",
        "parameters": [{"name": "...", "type": "..."}],
        "return_type": "...", "docstring": "...",
        "qmd_evidence": "<if Deep tier, else omit>"}
     ]
   }
   ```

**For DELETED files:** No extraction needed — deletions handled in merge step.

**For MOVED files:** Re-extract at new location to update file:line references.

**Re-export tracing (Forge/Deep only):** After extracting changed files, check if any public exports from the package entry point (`__init__.py`, `index.ts`, `lib.rs`) are unresolved — particularly when a changed file is part of a module re-export chain. Follow the **Re-Export Tracing** protocol in `{extractionPatternsTracingData}` to trace unresolved symbols to their actual definition files.

### 2b. CCC Semantic Ranking (Forge+ and Deep with ccc)

**IF `tools.ccc` is true in forge-tier.yaml:**

Before aggregating extraction results, use CCC to assess semantic significance of changes:

1. Run `ccc_bridge.search("{skill_name}", source_root, top_k=15)` — **Tool resolution:** `/ccc` skill search (Claude Code), ccc MCP (Cursor), `ccc search` (CLI) — to get the skill's most semantically central files
2. Cross-reference the change manifest files with CCC results
3. Files appearing in BOTH the change manifest AND CCC's top results are **semantically significant changes** — flag them for priority in the merge step
4. Store `{ccc_significant_changes: [{file, score}]}` in context

This helps the merge step (section 4) prioritize which changes are most likely to affect the skill's core content vs. peripheral modifications.

CCC failures: skip ranking silently, all changes treated equally.

**Note on remote sources:** If `source_root` is a workspace clone, the CCC index may already exist from a prior forge and can be reused via `ccc search --refresh`. If the source is an ephemeral fallback clone, the clone path is not indexed by CCC — the search returns empty results, so semantic ranking is skipped and all changes are treated equally.

**IF `tools.ccc` is false:** Skip this section silently.

### 3. Deep Tier QMD Enrichment (Conditional)

**ONLY if forge_tier == Deep:**

Read the `qmd_collections` registry from `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`.

Find the collection entry matching the current skill: look for an entry where `skill_name` matches the skill being updated AND `type` is `"extraction"`.

**If a matching extraction collection is found:**
Launch a subprocess that loads qmd_bridge and for each changed export:
1. Queries the `{skill_name}-extraction` collection for semantic context related to the export
2. Searches for usage patterns, documentation references, temporal history
3. Returns T2 evidence per export (usage frequency, context snippets, related concepts)

**If no matching collection found in registry:**
Log: "No QMD extraction collection found for {skill_name}. T2 enrichment skipped. Re-run [CS] Create Skill to generate the collection."
Continue without T2 enrichment — extraction still produces T1 results.

**If forge_tier != Deep:** Skip this section with notice: "QMD enrichment skipped (tier: {forge_tier})"

### 4. Compile Extraction Results

Aggregate all subprocess results into structured extraction data:

```
Extraction Results:
  files_extracted: [count]
  exports_extracted: [count]
  confidence_breakdown:
    T1: [count]
    T1-low: [count]
    T2: [count]

  Per-file extractions:
    {file_path}:
      exports:
        - name: {export_name}
          type: function|class|type|constant
          signature: {full signature}
          location: {file}:{start_line}-{end_line}
          confidence: T1|T1-low|T2
          parameters: [{name, type}]
          return_type: {type}
          docstring: {summary}
          qmd_evidence: {if Deep tier}
```

### 5. Display Extraction Summary and Auto-Proceed

"**Re-Extraction Complete:**

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Files extracted | {count} |
| Exports extracted | {count} |
| T1 (AST-verified) | {count} |
| T1-low (pattern-matched) | {count} |
| T2 (QMD-enriched) | {count} |

**Proceeding to merge with existing skill...**"

### 6. Route to Next Step

This step auto-proceeds — no user choices. Once all changed files are extracted and results compiled, load and fully read the next file, then execute it, per the branch that applies:

- **`dry_run_mode == true`** → display "**Dry-run mode — skipping merge/validate/write.** Loading report..." and load `report.md` (NOT `{nextStepFile}`); it emits status `dry-run` describing what merge+write would have done. No artifact is modified on disk by this run.
- **Otherwise** → display "**Proceeding to merge...**" and load `{nextStepFile}` (merge.md) to begin the merge operation.
