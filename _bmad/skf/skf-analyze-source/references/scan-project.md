# Step 2: Scan Project

## STEP GOAL:

To map the complete project structure by scanning directory trees, detecting service boundaries, identifying package manifests, and cataloging entry points — building the foundation that subsequent steps use for unit identification.

## Rules

- Focus only on structural scanning — do not classify units or map exports yet
- Do not read source file contents beyond manifest files and entry points
- Delegate per-file scanning to subagents in parallel when many files are involved (main-thread fallback is fine)
- Tier-aware scanning depth: Quick (file structure), Forge (+ manifest parsing), Deep (+ config analysis)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Load Context

Read {outputFile} frontmatter to obtain:
- `project_paths[]` — the root(s) to scan (one or more paths/URLs)
- `constituent_refs` — optional per-path git ref overrides (present only when `project_paths` has multiple entries and explicit refs were supplied via `--target-refs`)
- `forge_tier` — determines scanning depth
- Scope hints (if any were provided in step 01)

Load {heuristicsFile} for reference on detection signals.

### 2. Scan Directory Structure

**Resolve `{scanManifestsHelper}`** from `{scanManifestsProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. HALT if no candidate exists.

**For each path in `project_paths[]`**, resolve the constituent ref (if any) and launch a subprocess that scans the project directory structure (aggregate results across all repos with clear repo-level grouping):

**Per-path ref resolution:** If `constituent_refs` is present and contains an entry for the current path, use that ref. For remote paths, this means cloning or fetching at the specified ref (`git clone --branch {ref} --depth 1` or `git show {ref}:<subpath>` for off-HEAD access). For local paths with a non-HEAD ref, check out or read from the specified ref using `git show {ref}:<path>`. When no `constituent_refs` entry exists for a path, use default ref resolution (HEAD for local, latest tag or HEAD for remote).

1. Map the top-level directory tree (2-3 levels deep)
2. Identify workspace configuration files (pnpm-workspace.yaml, lerna.json, Cargo.toml [workspace], go.work, etc.)
3. Enumerate package manifests deterministically — invoke `uv run {scanManifestsHelper} scan {path}` and parse the JSON envelope. The script returns `{manifests[], total_unique, monorepo, warnings?}` covering npm/python/rust/go/maven/gradle/ruby/composer/swift; record each `{path, ecosystem}` for the manifests catalog in §4 and capture `monorepo` for the boundary-signal pass in §3
4. Locate entry point files (index.ts, main.ts, app.ts, main.go, main.rs, __init__.py, etc.)
5. Detect service configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, kubernetes manifests, serverless.yml) — keep this step LLM-driven; file glob + presence check is sufficient, no parsing required
6. Return structured findings — file paths and types only, not contents. When `constituent_refs` was used, include the resolved ref in each repo-level result group: `{path, ref, manifests[], monorepo, warnings?}`

**If subprocess unavailable:** Perform directory scanning in main thread using file I/O tools.

**Apply scope hints if provided:**
- If specific directories were given, scan only those
- If exclusion patterns were given, skip matching directories

**Deep tier additional scanning (IF Deep tier):**
- Use ast-grep to detect structural patterns across the codebase: `ast-grep -p 'class $NAME' --lang python` (or equivalent per language) to build a class/type inventory
- Use ast-grep to identify exported function patterns: `ast-grep -p 'def $FUNC($$$PARAMS)' --lang python` at entry points
- If QMD is available, query for temporal context on the project: recent changes, active development areas, refactoring patterns
- Record Deep-tier findings separately — they supplement (not replace) the Quick/Forge scan results

### 3. Detect Service Boundaries

Based on scan results, identify potential service boundaries:

**Strong boundary signals:**
- Independent package manifest (own package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Docker/container configuration
- Separate entry point file
- Workspace member listing

**Document each detected boundary with:**
- Path relative to project root
- Boundary type (service / package / module)
- Detection signals found (list specific files)
- Confidence level (strong / moderate / weak)

### 4. Catalog Manifests and Entry Points

Create a structured catalog:

**Manifests found:**
| Path | Type | Language Indicator |
|------|------|-------------------|
| {path} | {manifest_type} | {language} |

**Entry points found:**
| Path | Type |
|------|------|
| {path} | {entry_type} |

**Service configurations found:**
| Path | Type |
|------|------|
| {path} | {config_type} |

### 5. Present Scan Results

"**Project Scan Complete**

**Project:** {project_path}
**Forge Tier:** {forge_tier}

**Structure Overview:**
{top-level directory tree}

**Detected Boundaries:** {count}
{list each boundary with path, type, confidence}

**Manifests Found:** {count}
{summary table}

**Entry Points Found:** {count}
{summary table}

**Service Configurations:** {count}
{summary table}

**Scope Applied:** {hints or 'Full project scan'}

Does this scan look complete? Any directories I should investigate further or skip?"

Wait for user feedback. If user identifies gaps, rescan as directed.

### 6. Append to Report

Append the complete "## Project Scan" section to {outputFile}:

Replace the placeholder `[Appended by scan-project]` with the full scan results including:
- Structure overview
- Detected boundaries table
- Manifests catalog
- Entry points catalog
- Service configurations catalog
- Scope notes

Update {outputFile} frontmatter:
```yaml
stepsCompleted: [append 'scan-project' to existing array]
lastStep: 'scan-project'
```

### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select:** [C] Continue to Unit Identification | [X] Cancel and exit"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF C: Save scan results to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF X: HARD HALT with exit code 6 (`user-cancelled`). Emit the error envelope on stderr with `halt_reason: "user-cancelled"` and counts/paths reflecting state at cancellation (shape in `references/headless-contract.md`)
- IF Any other: help user, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#7-present-menu-options)

**GATE [default: C]** — present the menu and wait for the user's choice. If `{headless_mode}`: auto-proceed with [C] Continue, log: "headless: auto-continue past scan results".
