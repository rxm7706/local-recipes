# Step 1: Initialize Analysis

## STEP GOAL:

To initialize the analyze-source workflow by loading configuration, detecting continuation state, accepting the target project path, checking for existing skills, and creating the analysis report document.

## Rules

- Focus only on initialization — do not begin scanning or analysis
- Collect project path and scope hints from user
- Verify prerequisites before proceeding

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

When `{headless_mode}` is true, every HARD HALT in this step emits the error envelope on **stderr** before exiting — shape and enum in `references/headless-contract.md` — using the exit code and `halt_reason` named at that HALT.

### 1. Check for Existing Report (Continuation Detection)

Look for {outputFile}.

**IF the file exists AND has `stepsCompleted` with entries:**
- The report filename is keyed to `{project_name}` (the forge workspace), not the analyzed target — so a report from a *different* target can collide here. Before resuming, establish the requested target and compare it to the existing report:
  - Determine the requested target now: if `--project-path <path>` was passed at invocation, set `project_paths[]` from it (comma-split if multiple); otherwise collect the path(s) using the section-3 "Collect Project Path" prompt and store as `project_paths[]`. (Section 3 does not re-prompt when `project_paths[]` is already populated here.)
  - Read the existing report's frontmatter `project_paths`.
  - **IF the existing report's `project_paths` matches the requested target:**
    - **IF this invocation carries the `[auto]` flag (e.g. `AN[auto]`):** do not route to {continueFile} — auto mode is a single idempotent pass, not a resumable interactive session. Skip continuation and proceed to section 2; the `[auto]` check in §2b re-enters step-auto-scope.md, which re-runs cleanly and overwrites the prior auto report. (This keeps a re-invoked or interrupted auto run on the auto path instead of dropping it into the interactive chain.)
    - **ELSE:** "**Found an existing analysis report. Resuming previous session...**" — Load, read entirely, then execute {continueFile}. **STOP HERE** — do not continue this sequence. ({continueFile} is mode-aware: a report written by a prior auto run resumes through the auto path, not the interactive chain.)
  - **ELSE (different target — stale collision):** the existing report belongs to another analysis. Archive it by renaming to `{forge_data_folder}/analyze-source-report-{project_name}-<UTC-timestamp>.md`, announce "**Existing report belongs to a different target — archived as <name>; starting a fresh analysis.**", then continue to section 2 (skip re-collecting the path in section 3 — it is already set).

**IF the file does not exist OR stepsCompleted is empty:**
- Continue to section 2

### 2. Verify Prerequisites

**Check forge-tier.yaml:**
- Look for `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`
- **IF missing:** HARD HALT — "**Cannot proceed.** forge-tier.yaml not found at `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`. Please run the setup workflow first to configure your forge tier (Quick/Forge/Forge+/Deep)."
- **IF found:** Read and note the forge tier value

**Apply tier override:** Read `{sidecar_path}/preferences.yaml`. If `tier_override` is set and is a valid tier value (Quick, Forge, Forge+, or Deep), use it instead of the detected tier.

"**Forge tier detected:** {tier} — analysis depth will be calibrated accordingly."

### 2b. Auto Mode Check

**Check for `[auto]` flag:** If `[auto]` was passed as a bracket modifier in the pipeline context (e.g., `AN[auto]`), set `{auto_mode}` = true.

**IF `{auto_mode}` is true:**

1. **Resolve project path:** If `project_paths[]` is already populated (from §1 continuation detection or `--project-path` arg), use it. Otherwise, if `--project-path <path>` was passed at invocation, set `project_paths[]` from it (comma-split if multiple). If neither is available, HARD HALT with exit code 2 (`input-missing`): "**Auto mode requires `--project-path` — no project path available.**"
2. **Validate the path(s):** For each provided path/URL, check that it exists (local) or is accessible (remote). If any invalid: HARD HALT with exit code 3 (`resolution-failure`): "**Path `{path}` doesn't appear to be valid.**"
3. **Create the analysis report** from {templateFile}. Populate frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   stepsCompleted: ['init']
   lastStep: 'init'
   lastContinued: ''
   date: '{current_date}'
   user_name: '{user_name}'
   project_name: '{project_name}'
   project_paths: ['{provided_project_path}']
   forge_tier: '{detected_tier}'
   existing_skills: []
   confirmed_units: []
   stack_skill_candidates: []
   nextWorkflow: ''
   mode: 'auto'
   ```
4. "**Auto mode activated — bypassing interactive analysis.**"
5. **Route to auto-scope:** Load, read fully, then execute `references/step-auto-scope.md`. **STOP HERE** — do not continue to §3 or any subsequent section.

**IF `{auto_mode}` is not true:**
Continue to §3 as normal — the entire interactive flow below is unchanged.

### 3. Collect Project Path

**Headless flag consumption:** If `project_paths[]` is already populated (e.g. collected by the section-1 stale-collision guard) OR `--project-path <path>` was passed at invocation, set/keep `project_paths[]` (comma-split the flag value if multiple paths were supplied), skip the prompt below, and proceed to validation. If `{headless_mode}` is true and no path is available from either source, HARD HALT with exit code 2 (`input-missing`): "**No project path — headless mode requires `--project-path`.**" (interactive prompting is unavailable headless). Otherwise prompt as today.

**Per-path ref overrides (`--target-refs`):** If `--target-refs <mapping>` was passed at invocation, parse it as a comma-separated list of `path:ref` pairs (e.g., `owner/repo:v1.0.0,owner/repo2:main`). Build a `constituent_refs` map from the pairs. Each key must match an entry in `project_paths[]` (validated after path collection). When `--target-refs` is absent but multiple `project_paths` exist, set `constituent_refs` to `{}` (empty — all paths use default ref resolution). When only a single path exists, omit `constituent_refs` entirely (use `target_ref` if set on the brief). `constituent_refs` and `target_ref` are mutually exclusive — if both are supplied, HALT with: "`--target-refs` and `--target-ref` are mutually exclusive. Use `--target-refs` for multi-path analysis, or `--target-ref` for single-path."

"**Please provide the project root path(s) to analyze** — I'll identify discrete skillable units and produce a skill-brief.yaml for each.

This can be:
- A single root directory of a repo or multi-service project
- Multiple paths or URLs (comma-separated) for multi-repo analysis (e.g., integration/stack skills)

Examples:
- `/path/to/project`
- `owner/repo, owner/repo2`
- `/path/to/project, https://github.com/owner/repo2`"

Wait for user input.

**Validate the path(s):**
- For each provided path/URL: check that it exists (local) or is accessible (remote)
- **IF any invalid:** "Path `{path}` doesn't appear to be valid. Please correct it."
- Store as `project_paths[]` array in report frontmatter (single path stored as 1-element array for consistency)
- **IF `constituent_refs` was built from `--target-refs`:** Validate that every key in the map matches an entry in `project_paths[]`. If any key has no matching path, HALT: "constituent_refs key `{key}` does not match any entry in project_paths."

**Collect intent hint** (drives recommendation ranking in Step 5):

**Headless flag consumption:** If `--intent-hint <text>` was passed at invocation, set workflow-context `intent_hint` directly from the flag value, skip the prompt below, and proceed. If `{headless_mode}` is true and no `--intent-hint` was supplied, set `intent_hint = ""` (empty) and proceed without prompting.

"**Optional: What are you hoping to get out of this analysis?**

For example:
- Skills for a specific domain (e.g., 'authentication and authorization')
- Target consumer agents (e.g., 'skills our backend team's AI assistants will call')
- Constraints (e.g., 'we only want stable public APIs, no internal modules')

Type details, or press Enter to skip."

Wait for user input. Store as workflow-context `intent_hint` (empty string if skipped).

### 4. Collect Optional Scope Hints

**Headless flag consumption:** If `--scope-hint <text>` was passed at invocation, set workflow-context `scope_hint` directly from the flag value, skip the prompt below, and proceed. If `{headless_mode}` is true and no `--scope-hint` was supplied, set `scope_hint = ""` (empty) and proceed without prompting.

"**Optional: Do you have scope hints to narrow the analysis?**

For example:
- Specific packages to focus on (e.g., `packages/auth`, `services/api`)
- Directories to exclude (e.g., `vendor/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`)

Enter scope hints, or press Enter to analyze the entire project."

Wait for user input. Document any hints provided.

### 5. Check for Existing Skills

Scan `{forge_data_folder}/*/skill-brief.yaml` (one level deep — each skill has its own subdirectory) for existing skill briefs.

**IF existing skills found:**
"**Existing skills detected:**
{list each existing skill name and path}

These units will be flagged as 'already skilled' during analysis. If source changes are detected, I'll recommend running update-skill instead of generating new briefs."

**IF no existing skills found:**
"**No existing skills found.** All identified units will be treated as new."

### 6. Create Analysis Report

Create {outputFile} from {templateFile}. If the write fails, HARD HALT with exit code 4 (`write-failed`) per `references/headless-contract.md`.

**Populate frontmatter:**
```yaml
stepsCompleted: ['init']
lastStep: 'init'
lastContinued: ''
date: '{current_date}'
user_name: '{user_name}'
project_name: '{project_name}'
project_paths: ['{provided_project_path}']
constituent_refs: {map from --target-refs, or omit if single path}
forge_tier: '{detected_tier}'
existing_skills: [{list of existing skill names}]
intent_hint: '{intent_hint or empty string}'
scope_hint: '{scope_hint or empty string}'
confirmed_units: []
stack_skill_candidates: []
nextWorkflow: ''
```

**`constituent_refs` presence rules:** Include the field only when `project_paths` has more than one entry. When present, keys are path strings matching `project_paths[]` entries, values are explicit git refs (tag/branch/commit). Paths with no explicit ref have no entry in the map (default ref resolution applies). Downstream steps (scan-project, brief generation) read this map to resolve per-constituent refs when cloning or reading off-HEAD constituents.

"**Initialization complete.**

**Project:** {project_path}
**Forge Tier:** {forge_tier}
**Existing Skills:** {count}
**Scope Hints:** {hints or 'None — full project analysis'}

**Proceeding to project scan...**"

### 7. Proceed to Next Step

Initialization is complete and the report is created — immediately load, read the entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}. This step has no user choices.
