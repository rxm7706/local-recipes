# Step 1b: CCC Index Verification

## STEP GOAL:

If ccc is available (`{ccc: true}` from step 1), invoke `{mergeCccExclusionsHelper}` to validate config-driven SKF exclusion patterns and merge them into `.cocoindex_code/settings.yml`, then verify the project's ccc index exists and create or refresh it if needed. Store index state and exclusion-merge results in context for step 2 to write into forge-tier.yaml and for step 4 to surface in the JSON envelope.

For Quick and Forge tiers, or when ccc is unavailable, skip silently and proceed.

## Rules

- Focus only on ccc index verification, exclusion-pattern merge, and (re-)indexing
- Do not display skip messages for Quick/Forge tiers
- Do not fail the workflow if ccc indexing fails
- The script owns exclusion-pattern validation — do not reimplement it in prose

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Check Eligibility

Read `{ccc}` and `{ccc_skip_index}` from context.

**If `{ccc}` is false:** Set `{ccc_index_result: "none", ccc_indexed_path: null, ccc_last_indexed: null, ccc_exclude_patterns: [], ccc_exclusion_warnings: [], settings_yml_written: false, settings_yml_patterns_added: 0}`. Proceed directly to section 4 (Auto-Proceed) — no output, no messaging.

**If `{ccc}` is true AND `{ccc_skip_index}` is true:** Run the exclusion-merge (section 3) so settings.yml stays current, then set `{ccc_index_result: "skipped", ccc_indexed_path: null, ccc_last_indexed: null}` and proceed to section 4 — do not run `ccc init` or `ccc index`. The envelope's `ccc_index.status` will be `"skipped"` so pipelines that plan an out-of-band re-index can distinguish "the operator opted out" from "indexing failed".

**If `{ccc}` is true AND `{ccc_skip_index}` is false:** Continue to section 2.

### 2. Check Existing Index State

Consume prior CCC state from stage 1's detector output (`prior.*` context flags) — no YAML re-parse and no timestamp math here. The detector already read forge-tier.yaml and computed the freshness verdict `{ccc_index_fresh}` against `{project-root}` and the current time (same-project path match AND `"fresh"`/`"created"` status AND `last_indexed` within the staleness threshold, defaulting to 24 hours).

Decide `{needs_reindex}` and `{ccc_index_result}` from `{ccc_index_fresh}`:

- If `{ccc_index_fresh}` is true → index is fresh. Set `{needs_reindex: false}`, `{ccc_index_result: "fresh", ccc_indexed_path: {project-root}, ccc_last_indexed: {previous_ccc_last_indexed}}`. Exclusions still merge in section 3 (which may force a re-index).
- If `{ccc_index_fresh}` is false (path mismatch, non-fresh status, stale timestamp, or any required prior CCC field null) → `{needs_reindex: true}`.

### 3. Merge SKF Exclusion Patterns

SKF infrastructure and output directories must be excluded from the CCC index — they contain workflow instructions, build artifacts, and generated skills that pollute semantic search results with zero extraction value.

Forward `skills_output_folder` and `forge_data_folder` from `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/config.yaml` **verbatim** — the script resolves `{project-root}/...` template strings and rejects absolute paths / placeholders / glob meta-chars internally. The step does no string surgery; that work moved into the helper. Invoke via `uv run`.

```bash
uv run {mergeCccExclusionsHelper} \
    --project-root "{project-root}" \
    --skills-output-folder "{skills_output_folder}" \
    --forge-data-folder "{forge_data_folder}"
```

The script (see `src/shared/scripts/skf-merge-ccc-exclusions.py` docstring for the full schema) builds the SKF exclusion list (4 always-include hardcoded patterns + 2 conditional from validated config), applies the validation rules to reject empty / absolute / glob-meta config values with actionable warnings, and performs an idempotent set-union merge into `{project-root}/.cocoindex_code/settings.yml`. User customizations are preserved. When the file does not exist yet (first-time setup before `ccc init`) the script creates it; when nothing new needs adding the script skips the write entirely (mtime preserved).

**Parse the JSON output and set context flags:**

- `{settings_yml_existed}` ← `settings_yml_existed`
- `{settings_yml_written}` ← `written`
- `{settings_yml_patterns_added}` ← `patterns_added`
- `{ccc_exclude_patterns}` ← `effective_patterns` (the script returns the final, sorted, deduplicated SKF pattern set after validation — consume verbatim; do not re-derive in prose).
- `{ccc_exclusion_warnings}` ← `warnings` (a list — step 4 folds them into the envelope's warnings array)

**If `{settings_yml_written}` is true** (new patterns merged into settings.yml): set `{needs_reindex: true}` — new exclusions require re-indexing for the index to reflect them. Display: "**CCC exclusions configured:** {patterns_added} SKF patterns applied to .cocoindex_code/settings.yml"

**If `{settings_yml_written}` is false** (idempotent re-run, all patterns already present): display nothing (exclusions already configured). Do NOT change `{needs_reindex}` — it stays at whatever section 2 set it to.

**Flow decision:**

- If `{needs_reindex}` is true: proceed to section 4
- If `{needs_reindex}` is false: proceed to section 5 (Auto-Proceed)

### 4. Create or Refresh CCC Index

**If `{ccc_daemon}` is `"stopped"` or `"healthy"`:** the `ccc index` command auto-starts the daemon when needed.

**If `{ccc_daemon}` is `"error"`:** attempt indexing anyway — errors will be caught below.

Run (CWD must be `{project-root}`):

```bash
ccc init
```

**If init fails** (project may already be initialized): continue — this is not an error. Note: when `{settings_yml_existed}` was false and `ccc init` just created the settings.yml, the merge in section 3 ran BEFORE ccc init. The script handles "no settings.yml exists" by creating one with just the SKF exclusions, which `ccc init` will then either preserve (if it merges) or overwrite (in which case the next workflow run re-merges). Either way the SKF exclusions end up in the file by the time `ccc index` runs the second time.

Before invoking `ccc index`, display: "**Building semantic index — this can take several minutes on large codebases (1000+ files). Run `ccc status` in another terminal to monitor progress.**" so the user does not assume the workflow has hung during the long-running call.

Then run:

```bash
ccc index
```

**Note:** `ccc index` can take several minutes on large codebases (1000+ files). Run with an extended timeout or in background mode. Use `ccc status` to verify completion — check that `Chunks` and `Files` counts are non-zero.

**If succeeds:**

- Run `ccc status` to get file count
- Store `{ccc_index_result: "created", ccc_indexed_path: {project-root}, ccc_last_indexed: {current ISO timestamp}, ccc_file_count: {count from ccc status}}`
- Display: "**CCC index created.** {ccc_file_count} files indexed for semantic discovery."

**If fails:**

- Store `{ccc_index_result: "failed", ccc_indexed_path: null, ccc_last_indexed: null, ccc_indexing_failed_reason: {error}}` (the failed-reason flag flows into step 4's envelope warnings)
- Display: "CCC indexing failed: {error}. Extraction will use direct AST scanning — semantic pre-ranking unavailable this session."
- Continue — this is not a workflow error

### 5. Auto-Proceed

After ccc index verification is complete (or skipped because ccc is unavailable), display "**Proceeding to write configuration...**", then load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, and execute it.
