# Skill Brief Schema

## Required Fields

| Field       | Type   | Constraint                                       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name        | string | kebab-case `[a-z0-9-]+`                          | Unique skill identifier                                                     |
| version     | string | Semantic version (`X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z-prerelease`) | Auto-detect from source (see Version Detection below), fall back to `1.0.0`. **Side effect on remote sources:** `skf-create-skill` treats `version` as an **implicit** `target_version` hint when `target_version` itself is absent — it will try to resolve `{version}` or `v{version}` to a git tag before cloning and fall back to HEAD with a warning if no tag matches. See `skf-create-skill/references/source-resolution-protocols.md` → "Implicit Tag Resolution". |
| source_repo | string | GitHub URL or local path                         | Repository or project root (optional when `source_type: "docs-only"`)       |
| language    | string | Recognized language                              | Primary programming language                                                |
| scope       | object | See Scope Object below                           | Boundary definition                                                         |
| description | string | 1-3 sentences                                    | What the skill covers                                                       |
| forge_tier  | string | `Quick` / `Forge` / `Forge+` / `Deep`            | Inherited from forge-tier.yaml (Title Case)                                 |
| created     | string | ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`                            | Generation date                                                             |
| created_by  | string | user_name from config                            | Who generated the brief                                                     |

## Optional Fields

| Field              | Type   | Constraint                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| source_type        | string | `source` or `docs-only`                          | Default `source`. When `docs-only`: `source_repo` optional, `doc_urls` required                                                                                                                                                |
| doc_urls           | array  | `{url, label, source?}` objects                  | Documentation URLs for T3 content. Required when `source_type: "docs-only"`. Optional `source` provenance enum: `language-registry` (registry-guaranteed corpus) \| `readme-detection` \| `homepage` \| `pages-api` \| `docs-folder` |
| `scripts_intent`   | string | `detect` / `none` / free-text                    | Describes whether scripts should be extracted. Values: `detect` (auto-detect from source — default when absent), `none` (skip scripts), or a free-text description of expected scripts (e.g., "CLI validation tools in bin/"). |
| `assets_intent`    | string | `detect` / `none` / free-text                    | Describes whether assets should be extracted. Values: `detect` (auto-detect from source — default when absent), `none` (skip assets), or a free-text description of expected assets (e.g., "JSON schemas in schemas/").        |
| `target_version`   | string | Semantic version (`X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z-prerelease`) | User-specified target version. When present, overrides auto-detection and becomes the skill's version. Recommended for docs-only skills where auto-detection is unavailable.                                                   |
| `target_ref`       | string | Git ref (tag or branch)                          | Optional. Explicit git ref used verbatim as the resolved `source_ref`, bypassing version-to-tag matching. Escape hatch for monorepo crate tags whose prefix differs from the skill name (e.g. tag `livekit/v0.7.42` for skill `livekit-rust`). Remote sources only. |
| `source_authority` | string | `official` / `community` / `internal`            | Default `community`. Set to `official` only when the skill creator is the library maintainer. Forced to `community` when `source_type: "docs-only"`.                                                                           |
| `source_ref`       | string | Git ref (tag/branch/HEAD)                        | Resolved git ref used for source access. Set automatically during tag resolution — do not set manually.                                                                                                                        |
| `scope.tier_a_include` | array | Glob patterns                                 | Optional. Narrower tier-A include list for stratified-scope monorepo skills. When present, `skf-test-skill` re-derives the coverage denominator from this list instead of the coarse `scope.include`, so the denominator reflects the authoring surface rather than incidentally-matched internal infrastructure. See `skf-test-skill/references/source-access-protocol.md` stratified-scope resolution. |

When `source_type: "docs-only"`:
- `source_repo` becomes optional (set to doc site URL for reference)
- `doc_urls` must have at least one entry
- `source_authority` is forced to `community` (T3 external documentation cannot be `official`)
- All extracted content gets `[EXT:{url}]` citations

## Version Detection

During brief creation, attempt to auto-detect the source version before defaulting to `"1.0.0"`. Check the first matching file in the source:

- **Python:** `pyproject.toml` `[project] version` (static) → if `dynamic = ["version"]`, check `__init__.py` for `__version__` → `_version.py` if exists → `setup.py` `version=` → `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** root `package.json` (`"version"`) → if root has `"private": true` with a `"workspaces"` array or lacks a `"version"` field, fall back to a primary workspace package's `package.json` (e.g., `code/core/package.json`, or the first matching `packages/*/package.json`). For GitHub sources, prefer `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` → `tag_name` when a non-pre-release tag exists, over a default-branch pre-release. Treat a version containing `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`, `-next`, or `-canary` as a pre-release.
- **Rust:** `Cargo.toml` `[package] version` (static) → if `version = { workspace = true }`, resolve from workspace root `Cargo.toml` → `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`
- **Go:** version tag from `go.mod` or `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`

If the source is a remote GitHub repo, use `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{file}` to read the version file. If the source is local, read the file directly.

If detection succeeds, use the detected version. If it fails or returns a non-semver value, fall back to `"1.0.0"`.

The create-skill workflow (extract) also performs version reconciliation at extraction time — if the source version has changed since the brief was created, the extraction step warns and uses the source version.

**Target version override:** When `target_version` is present in the brief, it takes precedence over auto-detection. Auto-detection still runs for informational purposes (displayed as "Detected version" alongside the user-specified "Target version"), but the `target_version` value is used as the brief's `version` field. This is particularly useful for docs-only skills (where no package manifest exists) and when the user wants to compile a skill for a specific older version.

**Pre-release handling:** If the detected version contains a pre-release tag (e.g., `1.0.0-beta.0`, `2.0.0-rc.1`), preserve it as-is. Pre-release tags are valid semver and must not be stripped. When comparing versions during reconciliation, use semver-aware comparison that respects pre-release ordering.

### Scope Rationale (Optional)

`scope.rationale` is a single optional object recording **why the scope type was chosen at authoring time**. Unlike `scope.amendments[]` (an additive log that accumulates post-authoring decisions across workflow runs), `scope.rationale` is one decision, written once by `skf-brief-skill` step 03 §2c and revised in place on a step-4 `[R]` re-entry. It sits structurally beside `scope.amendments`, reusing the same structured / script-readable / human-auditable ethos rather than a prose decision log.

**Fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `recommended` | string (one of the six `scope.type` values) | yes | `skf-recommend-scope-type.py` → `scope_type` |
| `chosen` | string (one of the six) | yes | final `scope.type` |
| `accepted_recommendation` | bool | yes | `chosen == recommended` |
| `heuristic` | string | yes | script `matched_heuristic` |
| `reason` | string | yes | accepted → script `rationale` verbatim; overridden → user's stated reason, or `"user overrode {recommended}->{chosen}; reason not stated"` |
| `recorded` | string (ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD`) | yes | current date — mirrors `amendments[].date` |

**Who reads `scope.rationale`:**

- Humans reviewing the brief — it records why the boundary was drawn the way it was.
- `skf-update-skill` Update intent MAY later surface conflicts against it (e.g., a scope change that contradicts the original authoring decision). **Not implemented now — deferred.** The field is forward-compatible; the reader is wired later.

**Backward compatibility:** `scope.rationale` is optional. Briefs without this field validate unchanged — treat missing as absent (null). Mirrors the `scope.amendments` backward-compat rule.

### Scope Amendments (Optional)

`scope.amendments[]` is an additive, optional audit log of scope decisions made by workflows after the brief was first authored. Two writer paths exist today:

- **Auth-doc promotions** (`category: "auth-doc"`) — `skf-create-skill` §2a and its mirror `skf-update-skill` §1b append entries when extraction discovers authoritative AI documentation files (`llms.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) that the original scope patterns excluded.
- **Scope-expansion promotions** (`category: "scope-expansion"`) — `skf-update-skill` §1c appends entries when an audit drift report flags out-of-scope new public API paths (typically a major-version restructure where the brief's `scope.include` no longer reflects the real surface).

**Entry fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | yes | Relative path (or glob, for `category: "scope-expansion"`) from source root to the file or tree being amended. For `promoted` actions this matches the literal entry added to `scope.include`. |
| `action` | string | yes | One of: `promoted` (path added to `scope.include`), `skipped` (user declined promotion; decision recorded to prevent re-prompting), `excluded` (path added to `scope.exclude` — only valid with `category: "scope-expansion"`; used by gap-driven rescope to remove an internal / `#[doc(hidden)]` / out-of-scope export from the public surface), `demoted-include` (path removed from `scope.include` — only valid with `category: "scope-expansion"`), `demoted-exclude` (path removed from `scope.exclude` — only valid with `category: "scope-expansion"`). |
| `category` | string | no | One of: `auth-doc` (default for entries without this field — the historical sole use case), `scope-expansion`. Distinguishes which workflow path wrote the entry and which writer-rules apply on re-runs. |
| `reason` | string | yes | Human-readable sentence explaining the decision. Either user-provided at prompt time or auto-generated. |
| `heuristic` | string | conditional | Required for `category: "auth-doc"` — the basename that matched (`llms.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.). Omit for `category: "scope-expansion"`. |
| `evidence` | string | conditional | Required for `category: "scope-expansion"` — short rationale from the source signal (e.g., a drift-report finding's evidence one-liner). Omit for `category: "auth-doc"`. |
| `date` | string | yes | ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) when the amendment was recorded. |
| `workflow` | string | yes | Workflow name that wrote the amendment (`skf-create-skill`, `skf-update-skill`). Identifies which workflow made the decision. |

**Promotion write-through:** When `action: "promoted"`, the workflow also appends the literal path to `scope.include`. This is a belt-and-suspenders design: future runs read `scope.include` during scope filtering and include the file in the filtered list automatically, so the §2a/§1b/§1c discovery loop finds no candidate and does not re-prompt. The `amendments[]` entry is the human-readable audit trail of *why* the path was added.

**Skip recording:** When `action: "skipped"`, the workflow does NOT modify `scope.include` or `scope.exclude`. The amendment entry alone is enough to prevent re-prompting, because the discovery loop checks `amendments[]` before prompting.

**Demotion (scope-expansion only):** `demoted-include` removes a previously-promoted path from `scope.include` — used when a prior `[P]` decision is reversed. `demoted-exclude` removes a path from `scope.exclude` — used when a previously excluded path needs to be re-evaluated. Both write the structural change and append the amendment so future runs see the rationale. Demotion is not valid for `category: "auth-doc"`: auth-doc skips already prevent re-prompting without scope mutation.

**Exclusion (scope-expansion only):** `excluded` adds a path to `scope.exclude` — written by `skf-update-skill` gap-driven rescope (detect-changes §0 rule R1) when a coverage gap's remediation is removal (the export is internal, `#[doc(hidden)]`, or out of scope). The amendment is the audit trail; the `scope.exclude` write is what shrinks the source barrel, so the legitimate scope reduction is expressed in the brief rather than by editing `metadata.stats`. This keeps the reduction visible to `skf-test-skill`'s denominator-deflation check, which re-derives the barrel from `scope.include` filtered by `scope.exclude`. Not valid for `category: "auth-doc"`.

**Backward compatibility:** `scope.amendments` is optional. Briefs without this field validate unchanged. Treat missing as an empty list. Existing entries without `category` are equivalent to `category: "auth-doc"` — readers must default the field when absent.

**Who reads `amendments[]`:**

- `skf-create-skill` §2a consults it to avoid re-prompting on decided auth-doc files.
- `skf-update-skill` §1b (mirror of §2a) consults it for the same auth-doc reason.
- `skf-update-skill` §1c consults it to avoid re-prompting on decided scope-expansion candidates and to honor prior `demoted-*` decisions.
- `skf-audit-skill` may optionally report on stale promotions (promoted paths that no longer exist in source) as a future enhancement — not currently implemented.
- Humans reading the brief see the audit trail of non-obvious scope decisions.

**Who writes `amendments[]`:**

- `skf-create-skill` §2a (Discovered Authoritative Files Protocol) — `category: "auth-doc"`
- `skf-update-skill` §1b (mirror of §2a applied during change detection) — `category: "auth-doc"`
- `skf-update-skill` §1c (Major-Version Scope Reconciliation) — `category: "scope-expansion"`
- `skf-update-skill` gap-driven rescope (detect-changes §0 rule R1) — `category: "scope-expansion"`, `action: "excluded"`
- Manual edits by the brief author are permitted but should include all required fields above (and `category` when the entry is not an auth-doc decision).

## Human-Readable Presentation Format

The runtime template lives in `references/confirm-brief.md` §2 — that is the single source of truth for how the brief is rendered for user confirmation (brief-skill step 4 only; analyze-source batch generation does not render). If the rendering format needs to change, edit the step file. This asset documents the data contract; the step owns the presentation.

## Validation Rules

1. `name` must be unique within {forge_data_folder}
2. `source_repo` must be accessible (gh api for GitHub, path exists for local)
3. `language` must be a recognized programming language
4. `scope.type` must be one of the six defined types
5. `scope.include` must have at least one pattern (exception: `docs-only` scope, where include patterns are optional since no source code is available)
6. `forge_tier` must be one of: Quick, Forge, Forge+, Deep (Title Case, must match the tier from forge-tier.yaml, or default to Quick)
7. When `source_type: "docs-only"`: `doc_urls` must have >= 1 entry, `source_repo` becomes optional
8. Each `doc_urls` entry must have a valid `url` field
