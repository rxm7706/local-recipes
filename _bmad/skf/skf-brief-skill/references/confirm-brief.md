# Step 4: Confirm Brief

## Rules

- Do not proceed without explicit user approval (P2 confirmation gate)

## Sequence

### 1. Assemble Complete Brief

Use the values already accepted in steps 01-03 directly — do not re-load `{briefSchemaPath}` here. The 18 fields below are all in conversation; the schema is only consulted in §4 if an inline adjustment needs a specific field's validation rule cited.

**Ratify run (`ratify_mode: true`):** steps 2-3 were skipped (interactive `[R]` at gather-intent §3.1a, or the headless §8 GATE `from_brief` route), so there is no fresh steps 01-03 output to compile. Use the brief context variables **hydrated from the parsed brief** at step 1 in place of that output — the hydrated variable names match the field references below one-for-one. `detected_version` is absent on this path; rely on the hydrated `version` (step 5 pins it via `version_resolved`).

Compile all gathered data from steps 01-03 into the complete brief:

- **name:** {skill name from step 01}
- **version:** {auto-detected from source, or "1.0.0" if not found — see schema for detection rules}
- **target_version:** {target_version from step 01, if set}
- **source_repo:** {target repo from step 01}
- **language:** {detected/confirmed language from steps 02-03}
- **description:** {derived from user intent in step 01}
- **forge_tier:** {tier from step 01}
- **created:** {current date}
- **created_by:** {user_name from config}
- **scope.type:** {scope type from step 03}
- **scope.include:** {include patterns from step 03}
- **scope.exclude:** {exclude patterns from step 03}
- **scope.notes:** {any scope notes from step 03}
- **scope.tier_a_include:** {tier-A authoring-surface patterns from step 03 §3c — omit if unset}
- **scope.rationale:** {recommended -> chosen, reason — from step 03}
- **source_type:** {source or docs-only, from step 01}
- **doc_urls:** {collected documentation URLs with labels, from steps 01/03 — include if source_type is "docs-only" or supplemental URLs were collected}
- **scripts_intent:** {detect/none/description from step 03, or "detect" if not explicitly set}
- **assets_intent:** {detect/none/description from step 03, or "detect" if not explicitly set}
- **source_authority:** {official/community/internal from step 01 — default "community"}

### 2. Present Brief for Review

Using the format below:

"**Review the complete skill brief before I write it.**

---

```
Skill Brief: {name}
====================

Target:      {source_repo}
Language:    {language}
Forge Tier:  {forge_tier} — {tier_gloss}
Description: {description}

Scope: {scope.type}
  Include: {scope.include patterns, one per line}
  Exclude: {scope.exclude patterns, one per line}
  Notes:   {scope.notes}
  Tier-A:  {scope.tier_a_include patterns, one per line — omit this line entirely if scope.tier_a_include unset}
  Rationale: {chosen} chosen over {recommended} — {reason}
             {omit this line entirely if scope.rationale absent}

{If source_type is "docs-only":}
Source Type: docs-only
Doc URLs:
  {doc_urls, one per line with labels}

{If source_type is "source" AND supplemental doc_urls collected:}
Supplemental Docs:
  {doc_urls, one per line with labels}

Scripts:    {scripts_intent} — {scripts_gloss}
Assets:     {assets_intent} — {assets_gloss}

Source Authority: {source_authority}

{If target_version is set:}
Target Version: {target_version} (user-specified)
Detected Version: {detected_version or "N/A"}
{Else:}
Version:    {version}

Created:    {created}
Created by: {created_by}
```

---

Glosses (substitute the matching one-liner for `{tier_gloss}`, `{scripts_gloss}`, `{assets_gloss}` above so the user can decode each value at a glance):

- **Forge tier glosses** —
  - `Quick`: text-only extraction; AST and semantic discovery off
  - `Forge`: AST-grep on; semantic and re-ranking off
  - `Forge+`: AST-grep + ccc semantic discovery; re-ranking off
  - `Deep`: full pipeline — AST + ccc + qmd portfolio search + LLM re-ranking

- **`scripts_intent` / `assets_intent` glosses** —
  - `detect`: SKF will scan source for the standard `scripts/`/`bin/`/`tools/`/`cli/` (or `assets/`/`templates/`/`schemas/`/`configs/`) directories during create-skill and decide automatically
  - `none`: no script/asset packaging — create-skill will skip the detection pass
  - free-text (anything else): a description of what to package; create-skill treats it as the user's spec

(For `docs-only` and `public-api` scope types the scripts/assets prompt is skipped in step 3 §5b — the values default to `detect` but the create-skill detection pass also no-ops for these scope types, so the gloss just clarifies that the recorded value will not actually fire any scan.)"

### 3. Highlight Items Needing Attention

Flag any fields that may need review:

{If language was overridden or low confidence:}
"**Note:** Language was {auto-detected / manually overridden}."

"**Description:** synthesized and confirmed in step 1 §7b. This is the text agents read when deciding whether to route to your skill — refine here if you want to tighten it now that the full brief is visible."

{If forge tier was defaulted:}
"**Note:** Forge tier defaulted to Quick (no forge-tier.yaml found)."

{If any scope patterns seem broad or narrow:}
"**Note:** {specific observation about scope breadth}."

{If target_version is set AND detected_version exists AND they differ:}
"**Note:** Target version ({target_version}) differs from detected source version ({detected_version}). The target version will be used for compilation."

"**This is your last chance to make changes before writing the file.**

You can:
- Adjust any field by telling me what to change
- Revise scope boundaries by selecting [R]
- Proceed to write by selecting [C]"

### 4. Handle Inline Adjustments

If the user requests changes to specific fields (name, description, version, etc.):
- If the adjustment requires explaining a field's validation rule or allowed values, load `{briefSchemaPath}` now (otherwise skip the read — the common path does not need it)
- Make the adjustment
- Re-present the updated brief
- Return to the menu

### 5. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: **Select an Option:** [R] Revise Scope [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Approve and Write [X] Cancel and exit

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF R: Load, read entire file, then execute {reviseStepFile} to re-enter scope definition
- IF A: Invoke {advancedElicitationSkill}, and when finished redisplay the menu
- IF P: Invoke {partyModeSkill}, and when finished redisplay the menu
- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF X: Treat as user-cancellation. Display `"Cancelled — no brief was written."` and HALT (exit code 6, `halt_reason: "user-cancelled"`). Cancellation here is non-destructive — step 5 has not run, no skill-brief.yaml file exists yet. `[X]` is interactive-only; the headless GATE never reaches this branch.
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond, apply any field adjustments, re-present brief if changed, then [Redisplay Menu Options](#5-present-menu-options)

#### Execution rules:

- **GATE [default: C]** — If `{headless_mode}`: auto-proceed with [C] Confirm, log: "headless: auto-confirm brief"
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu
- User can chat, request field changes, or ask questions — always respond and then redisplay menu
