# Step 7: Workflow Health Check

## STEP GOAL:

Chain to the shared workflow self-improvement health check at `{nextStepFile}`. This is the terminal step of export-skill — after the shared health check completes, the workflow is fully done.

## Rules

- No user-facing reports, file writes, or result contracts in this step — those belong in step 6
- Delegate directly to `{nextStepFile}` with no additional commentary
- Do not attempt any other action between loading this step and executing `{nextStepFile}`

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

Load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.
