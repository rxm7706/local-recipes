"""Deterministic Completeness Score Calculator.

Pure-function scoring script for the SKF test-skill workflow (step-05).
Implements the weight tables, skip conditions, and proportional redistribution
defined in scoring-rules.md.

CLI usage:
  uv run compute-score.py '<JSON>'                  # JSON literal as positional arg
  uv run compute-score.py --json-input '<JSON>'     # explicit flag form
  cat input.json | uv run compute-score.py --stdin  # piped input

Input schema (one object):
  {
    "mode": "contextual" | "naive",
    "tier": "Quick" | "Forge" | "Forge+" | "Deep",
    "scores": {
      "exportCoverage": <0-100>,
      "signatureAccuracy": <0-100>,
      "typeCoverage": <0-100>,
      "coherence": <0-100>,
      "externalValidation": <0-100>
    },
    "threshold": <0-100, optional, default 80>,
    "evidenceCount": <int, optional, used for INCONCLUSIVE floor>,
    "analysisConfidence": "<optional string; 'degraded' fires the tooling cap>",
    "toolingStatus": "<optional string; a '*-missing' marker fires the tooling cap>"
  }

Verdict override (post-score caps + threshold fallback — see compute_score):
  When a cap or the threshold fallback engages, the output additionally carries
  `effectiveResult` (the final verdict after caps/fallback), `capReason`
  (string or null), `thresholdFallback` (bool), and `originalThreshold` (the
  pre-fallback threshold, or null). When neither engages, those keys are omitted
  and `result` is the final verdict. `result` itself is never mutated — it is
  always the pre-cap/pre-fallback score-vs-threshold (or evidence-floor) verdict.

Exit codes:
  0  — input was parsed; either a score was computed (verdict may be
       PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE) or a schema/validation error object
       ({"error": ..., "code": "INVALID_INPUT"}) was emitted as JSON
  1  — input could not be parsed at all (no input provided, or malformed JSON)

# --- Redistribution equivalence classes (moved here from scoring-rules.md) ---
#
# Determinism note for maintainers — NOT reader-model context. The redistributed
# `weights` / `activeCategories` / `skippedCategories` output depends ONLY on
# three things: the base table (contextual vs naive), whether Signature Accuracy
# + Type Coverage are skipped (Quick tier OR docsOnly OR state2 OR stackSkill OR
# referenceApp), and whether External Validation is skipped (externalValidation
# is null). Every (mode × tier × docsOnly × state2 × stackSkill × referenceApp)
# cell with an identical skip set + base table therefore reduces to the same
# equivalence class below and emits identical final weights for identical input
# scores — only the `skipReasons` string differs. The prompt (score.md) never
# names a class or fixture; it sets the flags and reads the script's output back.
# The rightmost column pins each class to a representative fixture in
# test/fixtures/compute-score-contract.json (see test-compute-score-contract.py);
# "(equiv.)" cells reduce algebraically to a listed representative.
