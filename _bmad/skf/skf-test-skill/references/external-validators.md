# Step 4b: External Validators

## STEP GOAL:

Run external validation tools (`skill-check` and `tessl`) against the skill directory, capture their scores and findings, and append results to the test report. These tools catch complementary issues that internal coverage and coherence checks miss: `skill-check` validates spec compliance while `tessl` evaluates content quality and actionability.

### 1. Resolve Skill Directory

Read {outputFile} frontmatter to get the skill directory path (`skillDir`).

### 1b. Check for Recent Validation Results (Auto-Reuse)

Before running external validators, check if `{forge_data_folder}/{skill_name}/evidence-report.md` contains validation results (a `## Validation Results` section with quality scores).

**Staleness check:** Determine whether SKILL.md has changed since the evidence report was generated. Walk through these checks in order:

**Pre-check (untracked or staged-only file):** Run `git ls-files --error-unmatch {skillDir}/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null`.
- If the command fails (exit code non-zero) or git is not available, the file is either **untracked** (new, never committed) or we're in a **non-git environment**:
  - Check if `{skillDir}/metadata.json` exists and has a `generation_date` field
  - Compare `metadata.json` `generation_date` against the evidence report's generation date (from its frontmatter `generated` field or the `## Validation Results` timestamp)
  - **Precision guard (mirror of the git-path Primary-cross check):** date-granularity equality is not proof of same-session generation. A same-day `update-skill` that regenerates SKILL.md *after* the cached evidence report was produced yields the same calendar date (e.g. `metadata.generation_date: 2026-05-23T00:00:00Z` vs evidence `generated: 2026-05-23`), so reusing on date-equality alone would publish pre-update scores for post-update content. Auto-reuse is safe **only** when both timestamps carry a real time-of-day component — neither a date-only string (`2026-05-23`) nor a midnight-coerced `…T00:00:00Z` — AND they match to the minute. In that case auto-reuse: the evidence report was generated from the same SKILL.md content.
  - Otherwise — if either timestamp is date-only or midnight-coerced, if they differ, or if `metadata.json` is missing or has no `generation_date` — treat as stale and proceed to section 2 for a fresh run. Forcing a fresh run on ambiguous precision matches the git path's bias toward freshness over reusing possibly-stale scores.
  - Note: "Staleness check: SKILL.md is untracked/non-git — using metadata.json timestamp comparison (date-only/midnight timestamps force a fresh run)."
- If the command succeeds (file is tracked by git), continue to Primary check below.

**Primary (git-tracked):** Run `git log -1 --format=%cI -- {skillDir}/SKILL.md` to get the last commit date of SKILL.md. Compare against the evidence report's generation date (from its frontmatter or the `## Validation Results` timestamp). If SKILL.md's last commit is newer, results are stale.

**Primary-cross (single-commit bundle detection):** The git-commit-timestamp comparison can return a false "fresh" when `update-skill` commits a regenerated SKILL.md alongside an unchanged `evidence-report.md` in the same commit — both files share the same `%cI` even though the cached validation results inside the evidence report were produced during an earlier run. To catch this, after the Primary check also compare `{skillDir}/metadata.json`'s `generation_date` field against the evidence report's internal `## Validation Results` timestamp (or its frontmatter `generated` field). If `metadata.json.generation_date` is strictly newer than the evidence report's internal validation timestamp, treat results as stale regardless of git commit parity — SKILL.md was regenerated after the cached validation ran, so the scores no longer reflect current content. If `metadata.json` is missing or has no `generation_date`, skip this cross-check and rely on the git comparison alone.

**Secondary (uncommitted changes):** Run `git diff --name-only -- {skillDir}/SKILL.md`. If output is non-empty, SKILL.md has uncommitted changes — treat results as stale regardless of commit dates. Also check `git diff --cached --name-only -- {skillDir}/SKILL.md` for staged-but-uncommitted changes — if non-empty, SKILL.md has been staged since last commit, treat results as stale.

If SKILL.md was modified after the evidence report was generated (e.g., after update-skill), the cached results are stale — skip auto-reuse and proceed to section 2 for a fresh run.

If recent, non-stale results exist (from a create-skill run that just completed), auto-reuse them — skip re-running validators and use the existing scores. Record: "External validation: reused from create-skill evidence report." Skip to section 5 (append results).

If no evidence report exists, it contains no validation section, or results are stale, proceed to section 2 (fresh run).

### 2. Run skill-check

**Check availability (short probe — 15s timeout):**

```bash
timeout 15s npx --no-install skill-check -h 2>/dev/null
```

Use `--no-install` so the probe never triggers a slow cold-cache download (npx
would otherwise fetch the package before printing help). Wrap in `timeout 15s`
so a hung probe cannot stall the workflow — consistent with the 120s cap used
on the actual validator run below. If the probe exits non-zero OR the 15s
timeout trips (exit code `124`), record `skill_check_score: N/A` and skip to
section 3.

**Run validation (120s timeout):**

```bash
timeout 120s npx skill-check check {skillDir} --format json --no-security-scan
```

If the command exits non-zero AND the exit code is `124` (GNU timeout's signal for the 120s wall-clock expiring), record `skill_check_score: N/A` with reason `timeout-120s`, log a warning, and skip to section 3. Other non-zero exits fall through to the regular JSON-parse path per the note below.

**Parse JSON output** to extract:
- `scores[].score` — overall score (0-100); match the entry by `relativePath` (or `skillId`) to the validated skill dir. Older skill-check builds exposed this as a top-level `qualityScore` — fall back to that if `scores[]` is absent.
- `diagnostics[]` — any remaining issues
- `summary.errorCount` and `summary.warningCount` — issue counts (the counts live under `summary`, not at the top level)

**Note:** `skill-check` may return a non-zero exit code even when `summary.errorCount` is 0. Always rely on the parsed JSON output, not the shell exit code.

Store in context: `skill_check_score`, `skill_check_diagnostics`

**If skill-check fails entirely:** Record `skill_check_score: N/A`, log warning, continue.

### 3. Run tessl

**Check availability (short probe — 15s timeout):**

```bash
timeout 15s npx --no-install -y tessl --version 2>/dev/null
```

Same rationale as the skill-check probe above: `--no-install` + `timeout 15s`
prevent a cold-cache fetch from stalling the workflow. If the probe exits
non-zero OR the 15s timeout trips (exit code `124`), record
`tessl_score: N/A` and skip to section 4.

**Run review (120s timeout):**

The §2 probe (`npx --no-install -y tessl --version`) already resolved tessl via the caller's npm cache or a locally-installed binary on `$PATH`. Invoke the same binary for the review — do not re-pin to a registry-published version.

```bash
# Use the tessl binary the §2 probe just verified. `--no-install` keeps
# the review execution path identical to the probe; no fresh registry
# fetch needed.
timeout 120s npx --no-install -y tessl skill review {skillDir}
```

Timeout handling mirrors skill-check: exit `124` → `tessl_score: N/A` with reason `timeout-120s`. If the percentage regex (`/(Description|Content|Review Score):\s*(\d+)%/`) returns fewer than three matches, record `tessl_score: N/A` with reason `parse-failure` and include the first 200 chars of output in evidence-report for debugging.

**Registry-404 branch:** if the invocation emits `npm error 404 Not Found` or the npx wrapper exits with a not-found condition, record `tessl_score: N/A` with reason `pin-not-on-registry` and continue. tessl has historically shipped under shifting scope/tag combinations, so a missing registry entry does not HALT the workflow.

**Parse the output** to extract:
- `description_score` — percentage (e.g., 100%)
- `content_score` — percentage (e.g., 45%)
- `review_score` — percentage (e.g., 73%)
- `validation_result` — PASSED/FAILED
- `judge_suggestions[]` — list of improvement suggestions

The tessl output is human-readable text, not JSON. Parse the percentage values from lines like "Description: 100%", "Content: 45%", "Review Score: 73%".

Store in context: `tessl_description_score`, `tessl_content_score`, `tessl_review_score`, `tessl_suggestions`

**If tessl content score < 70%:** Flag a warning:

"**Content quality warning:** tessl scored content at {score}%. This often indicates SKILL.md lacks inline actionable content (e.g., after split-body). If this is a split-body skill, the score drop is expected — tessl evaluates only SKILL.md body, not `references/*.md` (see scoring-rules.md). Consider using selective split to keep actionable content inline."

**If tessl fails entirely:** Record `tessl_score: N/A`, log warning, continue.

### 4. Calculate Combined External Score

The combined external score feeds `externalValidation` into the scoring script (step 5), so its mean is computed by a script, not in-prompt. Both scores are on the same 0-100 scale (skill-check quality score; tessl review percentage). Pass each score, or `null` when its tool did not run or returned N/A (`{externalScoreScript}` resolves relative to the skill root):

```bash
echo '{"skillCheckScore": <score or null>, "tesslReviewScore": <score or null>}' | uv run {externalScoreScript} --stdin
```

Read the result — do not re-average by hand:

- `externalScore` — the combined score: the mean when both tools ran, the single score when one ran, or `null` when neither ran (the scoring step redistributes the external-validation weight on `null`).
- `toolsUsed[]` — the tools that contributed.

Record `external_score: N/A` when `externalScore` is `null`.

### 5. Append External Validation to Output

Append to `{outputFile}`:

```markdown
## External Validation

### skill-check
- **Available:** {yes/no}
- **Quality Score:** {score}/100
- **Errors:** {count}
- **Warnings:** {count}
- **Diagnostics:** {list or "none"}

### tessl
- **Available:** {yes/no}
- **Validation:** {PASSED/FAILED}
- **Description Score:** {score}%
- **Content Score:** {score}%
- **Review Score:** {score}%
- **Suggestions:**
{bulleted list of judge suggestions}

### Combined External Score
- **External Validation Score:** {external_score}%
- **Tools used:** {list of tools that ran}
```

### 6. Report Results

Report the external validation result to the user: the per-tool scores and availability (skill-check out of 100, tessl as a percentage average, each `available` or `skipped`), the combined external score, and a content-quality warning if tessl content is below 70%. Then proceed to scoring.
