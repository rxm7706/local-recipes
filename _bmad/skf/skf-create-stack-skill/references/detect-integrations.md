# Step 5: Detect Integrations

## STEP GOAL:

Analyze co-import patterns between confirmed libraries to identify integration points — where and how libraries connect in this specific codebase.

## Rules

- Focus on detecting cross-library patterns using subprocess Pattern 1 (grep/search)
- Do not compile SKILL.md (Step 06)

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Generate Library Pairs

From `confirmed_dependencies`, conceptually you have N*(N-1)/2 unordered pairs. Rather than enumerating and grep-testing each one, prune the matrix via a deterministic **file-list intersection fast path** (MANDATORY first pass, all N): pairs whose per-library file lists do not overlap cannot be integration candidates by construction — drop them. Subsequent grep passes (§2) run only against pairs with a non-empty intersection, and grep scope is restricted to those intersection files rather than the whole source tree. This is NOT a "subprocess-unavailable" fallback; it is the default strategy for every N. Rationale: at N≈21 this collapses 210 prescribed pair greps to ~12 non-empty-intersection pairs in typical codebases; at larger N the compression is even greater.

**Compute the intersection deterministically via the shared script:**

1. **Build the libraries JSON** from the per-library file enumeration recorded by step 3 import-count extraction. Skip libraries where step 04 reported extraction failure. Shape:
   ```json
   [
     {"name": "<library-name>", "files": ["<rel-path-forward-slash>", ...]},
     ...
   ]
   ```
2. **Invoke the script** via stdin (or a temp file under `{forge_data_folder}/` if stdin piping is unavailable):

   **Resolve `{pairIntersectHelper}`** from `{pairIntersectProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. HALT if no candidate exists.

   ```bash
   uv run {pairIntersectHelper} intersect --libraries -
   ```
   piping the libraries JSON on stdin. The script emits:
   ```json
   {
     "pairs": [{"a": "<lib>", "b": "<lib>", "intersection_count": N, "files": [...]}, ...],
     "truncated": <bool>,
     "total_pairs": <int>
   }
   ```
   `pairs[]` is sorted by `intersection_count` DESC, then `(a, b)` ASC for stable ordering. Default Top-K cap is **20** (matches S7 below); pass `--top-k N` to override.
3. **Parse the JSON result** and use `pairs[]` as the qualifying-pair set for §2 onward. The `intersection_count` is the candidate file count for the §2 2-file threshold pre-grep; `files[]` is the grep-scope for that pair.

**Top-K cap (S7, 20):** If the script's response has `truncated: true`, more pairs than the cap had non-empty intersections. Surface a user-visible warning composed as: `"non-empty-intersection pair count {total_pairs} exceeds cap — analyzing top 20 by intersection size; {total_pairs - 20} pairs skipped"`. Record this cap in the evidence report. (Tie-break by intersection size is what the script sorts on; if you need to override the cap intentionally, pass `--top-k N` and document the rationale.) The cap is a second-order safety limit, not a primary strategy — the file-intersection prune does the bulk of the work.

Report: "**Analyzing {pair_count} library pairs for integration patterns** (pruned from {N*(N-1)/2} via file-list intersection; {capped_count} after Top-K if applicable)**...**"

### 2. Detect Co-Import Files

**If `compose_mode` is true:**

Instead of co-import grep, detect integrations from architecture document:

1. Load `{composeModeRulesPath}` for integration evidence format rules
2. **If `{architecture_doc_path}` is null or not available:** Skip directly to the "If no architecture document available" fallback below
3. **Compute qualifying co-mention pairs deterministically via the shared script.** The precision guards (word-boundary matching `\b{skill_name}\b` case-insensitive to reject substrings like `react` inside `reactive`; H1/H2 section exclusion for headers that normalise to `introduction`, `overview`, `glossary`, `table of contents`, `references`, `appendix`, or `index`, with heading text itself never a co-mention source; and the ≥2-distinct-body-paragraph gate) are a scan-and-count with one correct answer per `(architecture_doc, skill-name-set)` — do not perform them in-prompt. Risks and rationale stay documented in `{composeModeRulesPath}` under "Compose-mode co-mention precision".

   **Resolve `{comentionHelper}`** from `{comentionProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins.

   ```bash
   uv run {comentionHelper} comention --doc {architecture_doc_path} --skills -
   ```
   piping the loaded skill names — the `confirmed_dependencies` names — as a JSON array on stdin (e.g. `["react", "express"]`; use a temp file under `{forge_data_folder}/` if stdin piping is unavailable). The script emits:
   ```json
   {
     "pairs": [
       {"a": "<skill>", "b": "<skill>", "paragraph_count": N,
        "evidence": [{"header": "<governing-header-or-null>", "excerpt": "<text>"}, ...]},
       ...
     ],
     "excluded_section_count": M
   }
   ```
   `pairs[]` contains only qualifying pairs (≥2 distinct body paragraphs), sorted by `paragraph_count` DESC then `(a, b)` ASC. Use `pairs[]` as the detected-integration-pair set for step 4 onward; each pair's `evidence[]` supplies the governing header and paragraph excerpts to quote as architecture-reference evidence.

   **Graceful degradation:** if no `{comentionProbeOrder}` candidate exists (e.g. `uv` unavailable on claude.ai web), perform the equivalent scan directly per the guards above and the script's `--help` contract, then proceed with the same qualifying-pair set.
4. For each detected integration pair (from `pairs[]`):
   - Load both skills' export lists and API signatures
   - Compose an integration section following the format from `{composeModeRulesPath}`
   - Include VS feasibility verdict if a feasibility report matching the filename pattern defined in `src/shared/references/feasibility-report-schema.md` exists under `{forge_data_folder}/` (timestamped `feasibility-report-{project_slug}-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.md` or the stable `feasibility-report-{project_slug}-latest.md` copy). Schema version `"1.0"` is required; see the schema for the full contract.
   - Cite evidence from both skills: `[from skill: {skill_name}]`

All integration evidence inherits confidence tiers from the source skills. Load and apply the full **Confidence Tier Inheritance** matrix from `{composeModeRulesPath}` to compute the correct tier for each pair (covers T1+T1, T1+T1-low, T1-low+T1-low, T1+T2, T1-low+T2, T2+T2 cases). Apply the `[composed]` suffix to all confidence labels — e.g., `T1 [composed]`, `T1-low [composed, +T2 annotations]`.

**VS verdict parsing (if feasibility report exists):** The feasibility report format is defined by the shared schema at `src/shared/references/feasibility-report-schema.md` (single source of truth; skf-verify-stack is the producer, this skill is the consumer). Follow the schema strictly:

- Locate the report via the filename pattern in the schema: `{forge_data_folder}/feasibility-report-{project_slug}-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.md` (or the stable `feasibility-report-{project_slug}-latest.md` copy next to it).
- **Schema version guard (deterministic gate):** Resolve `{validateFeasibilityReportHelper}` from `{validateFeasibilityReportProbeOrder}` (first existing path wins) and run it against the located report:

  ```bash
  python3 {validateFeasibilityReportHelper} <located-report-path>
  ```

  Consume `schemaVersionOk` / `schemaVersionFound` from its JSON. If `schemaVersionOk` is false, HALT with `"feasibility-report schemaVersion mismatch: expected '1.0', got '{schemaVersionFound}' — refusing to proceed"`, then emit the result envelope on stderr per the Result Contract in SKILL.md and exit `2`. The script's structural findings (`headingsOk` / `orderViolations`) are advisory for this consumer — it gates only on schemaVersion. **If the helper does not resolve or cannot run,** parse the report's YAML frontmatter directly and compare `schemaVersion` to the literal `1.0`, applying the same HALT (a missing or mismatched version halts identically). Unknown versions are never interpreted.

  ```
  SKF_STACK_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"error","skill_package":null,"skill_name":"{project_name}-stack","stack_libraries":[],"mode":"compose","exit_code":2,"halt_reason":"schema-version-mismatch"}
  ```
- Read `overallVerdict` from frontmatter (exactly one of `FEASIBLE|CONDITIONALLY_FEASIBLE|NOT_FEASIBLE`).
- Parse the `## Integration Verdicts` markdown table for per-pair verdicts (exactly one of `Verified|Plausible|Risky|Blocked`). Any unknown verdict token is a hard error per the schema — do not silently drop or map.
- For each architecture-detected pair, include `VS overall: {overallVerdict}` and `VS pair: {verdict}` in the integration evidence per the format in `{composeModeRulesPath}`. VS verdicts do not apply to inferred integrations since the VS report operates on architecture-described interactions only. Additionally, flag any pairs where VS reported `Risky` or `Blocked` by appending a `[VS: Risky]` or `[VS: Blocked]` warning annotation to the integration entry.

If no architecture document available:
- Infer potential integrations from skills sharing the same `language` field or sharing domain keywords in their SKILL.md descriptions (use the `usage_patterns` and `exports` fields from `per_library_extractions[]` built in step 4, or reload SKILL.md from the version-aware path: use `skill_package_path` from step 2, or resolve via `{skills_output_folder}/{skill_dir}/active/{skill_dir}/SKILL.md` — see `knowledge/version-paths.md`)
- Mark inferred integrations: `[inferred from shared domain]` — use this suffix instead of `[composed]` for inferred integrations
- Inferred integrations qualify automatically — no file-count threshold applies

Skip to section 3 (Classify Integration Types) with the compose-mode pairs.

**If not compose_mode:**

For each library pair (A, B):

**Launch a subprocess** that greps across all source files to find files importing BOTH library A and library B. Return only file paths and import line numbers.

**Subprocess resolution:** Use the Grep tool (Claude Code), built-in search (Cursor), or `grep`/`rg` (CLI). See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

**Subprocess returns:** `{pair: [A, B], co_import_files: [{path, line_A, line_B}], count: N}`

**Note on file-list intersection:** per §1, the intersection has already been computed and the pair's `intersection_files` set is known. The grep below runs against that set only, not the whole source tree. If a subprocess is entirely unavailable, the intersection itself is the integration evidence — count the intersection files against the 2-file threshold below without the grep. The intersection is mandatory first-pass work, not a fallback.

**Threshold:** A pair must have 2+ co-import files to qualify as an integration pattern (single file co-imports may be incidental).

**CCC Semantic Augmentation (Forge+ and Deep with ccc):**

If `tools.ccc` is true AND `ccc_index.status` is `"fresh"` or `"stale"` in forge-tier.yaml, augment co-import detection with semantic search (max 1 query per library pair):

For each library pair with **0 or 1 co-import files** (below the 2-file threshold — S9, symmetric to give the 0-hit case the same chance as the 1-hit case), run `ccc_bridge.search("{libA} {libB}", source_root, top_k=10)` to find files where the two libraries interact semantically — even without explicit import co-location. If CCC returns additional files where both libraries appear, add them to the pair's co-import candidate list and re-evaluate against the 2-file threshold.

**CCC precision guard for 1-file pairs (H3):** When a CCC hit would elevate a 1-file pair to qualifying status, run a post-hoc verification on that file: re-grep the file and confirm it contains explicit import statements for **both** libraries (per the ecosystem import patterns from `{manifestPatternsPath}`). If either import is missing (e.g., one library is only name-dropped in a comment or string), drop the CCC-added file from the candidate list. Only pairs with ≥2 files that each contain explicit imports for both libraries qualify. Log rejected CCC candidates in workflow state for the evidence report.

**Tool resolution for ccc_bridge.search:** Use `/ccc` skill search (Claude Code), ccc MCP server (Cursor), or `ccc search "{libA} {libB}" --path {source_root} --top 10` (CLI). See `knowledge/tool-resolution.md`.

For pairs that already qualify (2+ files), CCC is not needed for detection — but the CCC results may surface additional integration files for richer classification in section 3.

CCC failures: skip augmentation silently, proceed with grep-only results.

### 3. Classify Integration Types

Load `{integrationPatternsPath}` for classification rules.

For each qualifying pair, analyze to classify the integration type against those pattern types (**in compose-mode**: all architecture-document-detected pairs qualify automatically — the 2+ co-import file threshold applies only in code-mode; **in code-mode**: pair must have 2+ co-import files):

For each detected integration:
- Identify the top 3 files demonstrating the pattern
- Extract a brief description of how the libraries connect
- **Assign confidence (M1/M3) — derive from per-library tiers + detection-method qualifier (NOT from AST):** integration detection here is grep + co-import (optionally CCC-augmented), never AST. The integration's confidence is the **weaker** of the two libraries' tiers from `per_library_extractions[]` (tie-break: T1-low > T1, T2 > T1-low, T3 > T2 — never overstate). Then append a detection-method qualifier:
  - `grep-co-import` — the pair qualified via direct co-import grep (the default).
  - `ccc-augmented` — the pair qualified only after CCC semantic search elevated it (per §2 CCC augmentation), and the post-hoc import verification (H3) confirmed both imports.
  - `architecture-co-mention` — compose-mode pair qualified via word-boundary co-mention in the architecture document (per §2 H2 guards). Maps to `detection_method: architecture_co_mention` in `provenance-map.json`.
  - `constituent-documented-contract` — compose-mode pair whose cross-library contract is documented in a constituent skill's integration docs (cited, e.g. a grep-verified upstream seam) but not co-mentioned in the architecture document. Maps to `detection_method: constituent_documented_contract` in `provenance-map.json`.
  - `inferred-shared-domain` — compose-mode pair without an architecture document, inferred from shared `language` or domain keywords (no cited contract). Maps to `detection_method: inferred_from_shared_domain` in `provenance-map.json`.
  - Render as `{tier} ({qualifier})` — e.g., `T1-low (grep-co-import)`, `T1 (ccc-augmented)`, `T1-low (architecture-co-mention) [composed]`. The `[composed]`/`[inferred from shared domain]` suffix from `{composeModeRulesPath}` is appended after the qualifier in compose-mode.

  **Provenance ↔ SKILL.md tier parity:** The tier derived above is the single value for this edge — write the *same* tier to both the SKILL.md integration label and `provenance-map.json` `integrations[].confidence`. The detection-method qualifier (and the `provenance-map.json` `detection_method` it maps to) records *how* the edge was found and is orthogonal to confidence; it never forces the tier into a fixed band.

### 4. Build Integration Graph

Assemble the integration graph:
- **Nodes:** Confirmed libraries (with extraction data from step 04)
- **Edges:** Detected integration pairs with type, file count, and description
- Identify **hub libraries** (connected to 3+ other libraries)
- Identify **cross-cutting patterns** (patterns spanning 3+ libraries)

### 5. Display Integration Summary

If integrations were detected, report the integration graph (`{lib_count}` libraries, `{pair_count}` pairs): the hub libraries (connected to 3+ others) with their partners, each detected pair (library A, library B, type, co-import file count, confidence tier), and any cross-cutting patterns spanning 3+ libraries. If none were detected, report that no co-import integration patterns were found — the libraries appear to operate independently, so the stack skill will carry library summaries without an integration layer.
