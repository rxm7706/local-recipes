# Create Stack Skill

## Overview

Produces a consolidated stack skill documenting how libraries connect. **Code-mode** analyzes dependency manifests and co-import patterns from actual source code. **Compose-mode** synthesizes from pre-generated individual skills and architecture documents when no codebase exists yet. Every finding must trace to actual code with file:line citations; in compose-mode, inferred integrations are permitted but must be labeled `[inferred from shared domain]`.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `references/<name>.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- The `knowledge/` and `shared/` prefixes are the exception: they resolve from the **SKF module root** (`{project-root}/_bmad/skf/` when installed, `src/` during development), not the skill root — they point at module-shared reference docs (`knowledge/tool-resolution.md`, `knowledge/version-paths.md`) and scripts/schemas (`shared/references/…`) that live once at the module root, mirroring the resolution note `references/health-check.md` carries for `shared/health-check.md`.
- `references/` holds prompt content carved out of SKILL.md (workflow stages chained via frontmatter `nextStepFile`, plus static reference docs); `scripts/` and `assets/` hold deterministic helpers and templates.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives, if present).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## Role

You are a dependency analyst and integration architect. You bring expertise in dependency analysis, cross-library integration patterns, and compositional architecture, while the user brings their project knowledge and scope preferences.

## Workflow Rules

These rules apply to every step in this workflow:

- Zero hallucination — all extracted content must trace to actual source code (compose-mode inferences must be labeled)
- Only load one step file at a time — never preload future steps
- If any instruction references a subprocess or tool you lack, achieve the outcome in your main context thread
- Always communicate in `{communication_language}`
- If `{headless_mode}` is true, auto-proceed through confirmation gates with their default action and log each auto-decision
- Warnings use a single accumulator — see `## Workflow state contract` below for shape and surfacing.

## Workflow state contract

Every step that emits a warning appends a structured entry to a single in-memory list named `workflow_warnings[]` (the one accumulator for the whole workflow). Each entry has the shape `{step: "step-NN", severity: "info|warn|error", code: "<short-slug>", message: "<human text>", context: {<optional fields>}}`. Step 7 surfaces these in `evidence-report.md`; step 8 may add validation findings; step 9 §5 reads the accumulated list and renders the user-facing "Warnings" section.

**Single-pass — no mid-run checkpoint.** State lives in memory until step 7 commits `provenance-map.json`/`evidence-report.md`; the workflow keeps no resumable checkpoint and On Activation does not probe for a prior run — the analysis is deterministic and cheap to redo, and the two gates are trivially re-confirmed. If interrupted before that commit, restart from step 1.

## Stages

| # | Step | File | Auto-proceed |
|---|------|------|--------------|
| 1 | Initialize & Mode Detection | references/init.md | No (confirm) |
| 2 | Detect Manifests | references/detect-manifests.md | Yes |
| 3 | Rank & Confirm Libraries | references/rank-and-confirm.md | No (confirm) |
| 4 | Parallel Extract | references/parallel-extract.md | Yes |
| 5 | Detect Integrations | references/detect-integrations.md | Yes |
| 6 | Compile Stack | references/compile-stack.md | No (review) |
| 7 | Generate Output | references/generate-output.md | Yes |
| 8 | Validate | references/validate.md | Yes |
| 9 | Report | references/report.md | Yes |
| 10 | Workflow Health Check | references/health-check.md | Yes |

## Invocation Contract

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Inputs** | project_path [required], mode (code/compose) [auto-detected] |
| **Gates** | step 3: Confirm Gate [C] | step 6: Review Gate [C] |
| **Outputs** | SKILL.md (stack), context-snippet.md, metadata.json |
| **Headless** | All gates auto-resolve with default action when `{headless_mode}` is true |
| **Exit codes** | See "Exit Codes" below |

## Exit Codes

Every HARD HALT in this workflow exits with a stable code so headless automators can branch on the failure class without grepping message text:

| Code | Meaning              | Raised by (halt_reason)                                                                     |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | success              | step 10 (terminal handoff to shared health-check)                                          |
| 2    | input / precondition invalid | step 1 §0 `config.yaml` missing/malformed (`config-missing`); step 2 §2 headless with no manifests (`no-manifests`, S2); step 4 §3 all extractions failed (`all-extractions-failed`, B7); step 5 §2 feasibility-report `schemaVersion` mismatch (`schema-version-mismatch`) |
| 3    | resolution-failure   | step 1 §1 `forge-tier.yaml` missing (`forge-tier-missing`); step 2 §0 compose-mode skill-resolution corruption (manifest + symlink both fail); step 2 §0 compose-mode zero qualifying skills (S1/B4); step 4 §0 compose-cycle — all `resolution-failure` |
| 4    | write-failure        | step 7 §1 stage-dir / commit-dir failure; step 7 §1 group-dir collision when an existing non-stack skill occupies the target path — both `write-failure` |
| 6    | user-cancelled       | any interactive menu in step 3 / step 6 when the user selects `[X]` Cancel and exit (`user-cancelled`) |

## Result Contract (Headless)

When `{headless_mode}` is true, step 9 emits a single-line JSON envelope on **stdout** before chaining to step 10, and every HARD HALT emits the same envelope shape on **stderr** with `status: "error"`:

```
SKF_STACK_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"success|error","skill_package":"…|null","skill_name":"…","stack_libraries":["…"],"mode":"code|compose","exit_code":0,"halt_reason":null}
```

`status` is `"success"` on the terminal happy path, `"error"` on any HALT. `skill_package` is the absolute path to the committed stack-skill directory (or `null` on error before commit). `skill_name` is the stack skill's published name (e.g. `{project_name}-stack`). `stack_libraries` is the array of library names included in the stack (constituent skill names in compose-mode, dependency names in code-mode). `mode` is `"code"` or `"compose"` per the run's resolved mode (`null` if the run halts before mode resolution). `halt_reason` is one of: `null` (success), `"config-missing"`, `"forge-tier-missing"`, `"no-manifests"`, `"all-extractions-failed"`, `"schema-version-mismatch"`, `"resolution-failure"`, `"write-failure"`, `"user-cancelled"`. `exit_code` matches the table above. Fields unknown at the halt point are `null` (`skill_name`) or `[]` (`stack_libraries`) — e.g. a `config-missing` halt precedes `project_name` resolution.

## On Activation

1. Load config from `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/config.yaml` and resolve:
   - `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `skills_output_folder`, `forge_data_folder`, `sidecar_path`

2. **Resolve `{headless_mode}`** with explicit precedence (B2):
   1. **Explicit disable wins.** If `--headless=false` or `--no-headless` was passed, `{headless_mode}` is `false` regardless of any preference.
   2. **Explicit enable next.** If `--headless` or `-H` was passed (without `=false`), `{headless_mode}` is `true`.
   3. **Preferences fallback.** Otherwise, read `headless_mode` from `{sidecar_path}/preferences.yaml` (`true` or `false`).
   4. **Default:** `false`.

3. **Resolve workflow customization.** Run:

   ```bash
   python3 {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py \
       --skill {skill-root} --key workflow
   ```

   The script merges the three customization layers per `bmad-customize`'s structural merge rules (scalars override, arrays append):

   - `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — bundled defaults
   - `_bmad/custom/<skill-name>.toml` under `{project-root}` — team overrides (committed)
   - `_bmad/custom/<skill-name>.user.toml` under `{project-root}` — personal overrides (gitignored)

   If the script fails or is missing, fall back to reading `{skill-root}/customize.toml` directly — the bundled defaults are an empty string for each path scalar.

   Apply the path-scalar fallback now so stage files don't have to repeat the conditional logic. For each of the five scalars, if the merged value is empty or absent, use the bundled default:

   - `{stackSkillTemplatePath}` ← `workflow.stack_skill_template_path` if non-empty, else `assets/stack-skill-template.md`
   - `{integrationPatternsPath}` ← `workflow.integration_patterns_path` if non-empty, else `references/integration-patterns.md`
   - `{manifestPatternsPath}` ← `workflow.manifest_patterns_path` if non-empty, else `references/manifest-patterns.md`
   - `{composeModeRulesPath}` ← `workflow.compose_mode_rules_path` if non-empty, else `references/compose-mode-rules.md`
   - `{provenanceMapSchemaPath}` ← `workflow.provenance_map_schema_path` if non-empty, else `assets/provenance-map-schema.md`

   Also resolve `{onCompleteCommand}` ← `workflow.on_complete` if non-empty, else empty string (no-op — `references/report.md` §6c skips the hook invocation entirely).

   Stash all five paths plus `{onCompleteCommand}` as workflow-context variables. Stage files reference `{stackSkillTemplatePath}` / `{integrationPatternsPath}` / `{manifestPatternsPath}` / `{composeModeRulesPath}` / `{provenanceMapSchemaPath}` directly; empty-string overrides fall through to the bundled default.

   Also apply the array surfaces: run `workflow.activation_steps_prepend` now, keep `workflow.persistent_facts` as standing context (`file:` entries load their contents), then run `workflow.activation_steps_append` after.

4. Load, read the full file, and then execute `references/init.md` to begin the workflow.
