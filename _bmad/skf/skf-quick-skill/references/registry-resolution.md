# Registry Resolution Patterns

## Package-to-Repo Resolution

When the user provides a package name instead of a GitHub URL, use this fallback chain to resolve the source repository.

### Detection: URL vs Package Name

- **GitHub URL:** Starts with `https://github.com/` or `github.com/` — extract org/repo directly
- **Package name:** Everything else — enter resolution chain below

### Resolution Fallback Chain

Try each registry in order. Stop at first success.

**Per-call timeout:** apply a 10s timeout to each registry HTTP call (15s for the web-search fallback) so a single hung registry cannot stall the workflow under hostile network conditions. Treat a timeout as a soft failure and fall through to the next entry in the chain.

#### 1. npm Registry (JavaScript/TypeScript)

```
URL: https://registry.npmjs.org/{package_name}
Field: repository.url
Fallback field: homepage
```

Extract `repository.url`, strip `git+` prefix and `.git` suffix if present.

#### 2. PyPI Registry (Python)

```
URL: https://pypi.org/pypi/{package_name}/json
Field: info.project_urls.Source OR info.project_urls.Repository OR info.home_page
```

Check `project_urls` keys in order: Source, Repository, Homepage. Filter for GitHub URLs.

#### 3. crates.io Registry (Rust)

```
URL: https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/{package_name}
Field: crate.repository
```

Direct `repository` field usually points to GitHub.

#### 4. Web Search Fallback

If all registry lookups fail:

```
Search: "{package_name} github repository"
```

Look for GitHub URL in top results. Verify it matches the package name.

#### 5. Resolution Failure

If all methods fail:

```
"Could not resolve '{package_name}' to a GitHub repository.

Please provide the GitHub URL directly, or check:
- Is the package name spelled correctly?
- Is it a private package?
- Is the source hosted on a non-GitHub platform?"
```

**Hard halt** — cannot proceed without a resolved source.

Language detection is authoritative in `resolve-target.md` §4 (Detect Language) — this file covers only the package-to-repo registry chain.
