# Step 5: Write & Validate

## STEP GOAL:

To write the compiled SKILL.md, context-snippet.md, and metadata.json to the versioned skill package, then validate them on disk against the agentskills.io specification at community tier. Writing happens here (before step 6 finalization) because `skill-check` is a file-based CLI — it reads artifacts from disk — so the files must exist before validation runs. Report any gaps or issues. Validation is advisory — issues are reported but do not block the workflow.

## Rules

- Write exactly what was compiled — do not modify content during writing or after validation
- Community-tier validation (lighter than official requirements)

## Steps

### 1. Create Output Directory

Resolve `{version}` from the extraction inventory's detected version, defaulting to `1.0.0` if not detected. Create the skill output directories:

```
{skill_group}                          # {skills_output_folder}/{repo_name}/
{skill_package}                        # {skills_output_folder}/{repo_name}/{version}/{repo_name}/
```

If `{skill_package}` already exists, confirm with user before overwriting:

"**Directory `{skill_package}` already exists.** Overwrite will replace the prior compiled output; validation results, result contracts, and any manual tweaks from the previous run will not be preserved. Overwrite existing files? [Y/N]"

- **If user selects Y:** Proceed to section 2.
- **If user selects N:** HARD HALT with **exit code 5 (overwrite-cancelled)** per the exit-code map in `references/halt-contract.md`: "Overwrite cancelled. Existing skill preserved. Run [QS] with a different skill name or remove the existing directory manually." Before exiting, emit the error result contract per `references/halt-contract.md` (`phase: "write-and-validate"`, `error.code: "overwrite-cancelled"`, `skill_package` set to the existing path that was preserved). Write the `-latest.json` envelope to disk here — `{skill_package}` is known, so consumers that hardcode that path see a deterministic file even on this cancelled run.

**GATE [default: Y]** — If `{headless_mode}` is true, auto-proceed with Y and log: "headless: overwriting existing `{skill_package}`".

### 2. Write Deliverables

Write the three compiled artifacts to the skill package so that validation in sections 3–7 has files on disk to read:

**File 1:** `{skill_package}/SKILL.md` — the compiled skill document
**File 2:** `{skill_package}/context-snippet.md` — the compressed context snippet. **Skip this write** if `{overrides.skip_snippet}` was set; the artifact is omitted from `outputs`.
**File 3:** `{skill_package}/metadata.json` — the machine-readable metadata

Confirm after each write: "Written: SKILL.md" / "Written: context-snippet.md" / "Written: metadata.json". When `--skip-snippet` is active, log "Skipped: context-snippet.md (--skip-snippet)" instead of the snippet write confirmation.

**If any write fails — HARD HALT (exit code 4, write-failure):** Before exiting, emit the error result contract per `references/halt-contract.md` (`phase: "write-and-validate"`, `error.code: "write-failure"`, `error.details: {failed_path: <path>, error: <details>}`, `skill_package` set, `outputs` listing any files that did write successfully before the failure).

"**Write failed:** Could not write to `{file_path}`.

Error: {error details}

Check:
- Does the output directory exist and is it writable?
- Is there sufficient disk space?
- Are there permission issues?"

### 3. Check Tool Availability

Run: `npx skill-check -h`

- If succeeds (returns usage information): Continue to automated validation (section 4)
- If fails (command not found or error): Skip to manual fallback in section 4

### 4. Validate SKILL.md via skill-check (if available)

**If `npx skill-check` is available**, run automated validation + security scan in one invocation against the skill package written in section 2 (security scan is enabled by default when `--no-security-scan` is omitted, so the same call covers §6 and avoids paying the npx startup cost twice):

```bash
npx skill-check check {skill_package} --fix --format json
```

This validates frontmatter, description, body limits, links, and formatting; runs the security scan; and auto-fixes deterministic issues (field ordering, slug format, required fields, trailing newlines).

**Parse JSON output** to extract:
- `scores[].score` — overall score (0-100); match the entry by `relativePath`/`skillId`
- `diagnostics[]` — remaining issues after auto-fix
- `fixed[]` — issues automatically corrected
- `security[]` (when present) — security findings, recorded as advisory warnings (security issues do not block output)

Record quality score, remaining diagnostics, and security findings as validation issues.

**If skill-check is not available**, run the shared frontmatter validator. Resolve `{frontmatterValidator}` from `{frontmatterValidatorProbeOrder}`; first existing path wins. If no candidate exists, log a high-severity issue ("frontmatter validator unavailable — both `npx skill-check` and `skf-validate-frontmatter.py` missing") and skip frontmatter validation.

```bash
uv run {frontmatterValidator} {skill_package}/SKILL.md --skill-dir-name {repo_name}
```

The validator emits JSON with `status` (`pass`/`fail`), `issues[]` (each with `severity`, `code`, `message`), and `frontmatter` (the parsed name/description). It checks frontmatter delimiters, name format (Unicode letters + digits + hyphens, no consecutive/trailing hyphens), name-directory match, description presence and length, and unknown fields against the agentskills.io spec. Record each `issues[]` entry as a validation issue with its reported severity. Missing frontmatter or missing required fields are high-severity — skills without valid frontmatter will fail `npx skills add` and `npx skill-check check`.

### 5. Validate Body, Snippet, and Metadata via skf-validate-output.py

Run the shared output validator against the on-disk skill package — it performs the body-structure, snippet-format, and metadata-shape checks. Pass `--skip-frontmatter` since §4 has already covered frontmatter.

**Resolve `{outputValidator}`:** probe `{outputValidatorProbeOrder}` (installed first, dev fallback); first existing path wins. If neither candidate exists, log a high-severity issue ("output validator unavailable — `skf-validate-output.py` missing") and skip body/snippet/metadata validation.

```bash
python3 {outputValidator} {skill_package} --generated-by quick-skill --skip-frontmatter
```

The validator emits JSON with `result` (PASS/FAIL), `validation.skill_md.body[]`, `validation.context_snippet.issues[]`, `validation.metadata.issues[]`, and a severity-bucketed `summary`. Record each issue as a validation issue at its reported severity.

The validator covers:

- **Body structure** — Overview, Description, Key Exports, Usage sections present (medium when missing)
- **Context snippet** — `[{name} v{version}]|root: ...` first line, `|IMPORTANT:` second line, ~80–120-token length
- **Metadata** — required string fields (`name`, `version`, `source_authority`, `language`, `generation_date`), `source_repo`, `generated_by`, `confidence_tier`, and `stats` numerics (`exports_documented`, `exports_public_api`, `exports_total`, `public_api_coverage`, `total_coverage`)

### 6. Security Scan (covered by §4)

Security findings are already collected from the §4 invocation (no separate `npx` round trip needed — `skill-check check ... --fix --format json` runs the security scan by default). If skill-check was unavailable in §3, log "security scan skipped — skill-check unavailable" in validation results.

### 7. Report Validation Results

"**Validation complete:**

**SKILL.md:** {pass/issues found} (quality score: {score}/100 if skill-check was available)
{list any issues}
{list any auto-fixed issues}

**context-snippet.md:** {pass/issues found}
{list any issues}

**metadata.json:** {pass/issues found}
{list any issues}

**Security:** {pass/warn/skipped}
{list any security findings}

**Overall:** {pass / N issues found}

{If issues found:}
These issues are advisory for community-tier skills. You can proceed to finalize or go back to adjust.

**Proceeding to finalize...**"

Set `validation_result` with pass/fail status, quality score, and issues list.

### 8. Auto-Proceed to Finalize

Once deliverables are written to `{skill_package}` and validation is reported (advisory), load and execute {nextStepFile} to finalize.
