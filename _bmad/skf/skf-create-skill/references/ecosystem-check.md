# Step 2: Ecosystem Check

## STEP GOAL:

To search the agentskills.io ecosystem for an existing official skill matching the brief, advise the user if one is found, and allow them to decide whether to proceed with compilation or install the existing skill.

## Rules

- Focus only on ecosystem search and presenting findings — do not begin extraction
- Do not halt the workflow if the ecosystem check fails or times out (5-second timeout)
- If a match is found, present it factually — let the user decide

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Check Ecosystem for Existing Skill

**Note:** Ecosystem lookup requires the agentskills.io registry API, which is not yet available. The `skill-check` CLI validates local skills but does not query a remote registry.

**If agentskills.io registry API is available:**

Query the ecosystem using the skill name from the brief:
- Call the registry API with brief.name — check if an official skill already exists
- Enforce 5-second timeout — if the query does not return within 5 seconds, treat as no match. Rationale: ecosystem check is an opportunistic advisory; a slow or degraded registry must not stall the compilation pipeline, and 5s is well beyond any healthy registry's p99 latency.
- Cache results for 24 hours (if re-running same skill). Rationale: the agentskills.io registry publishes new official skills in daily batches; a 24-hour TTL balances freshness against redundant network calls during iterative brief refinement.

**If registry API is not available (current default):**

Skip completely and silently. Do not output any message about API unavailability or the ecosystem check being skipped. Emit zero text to the console. Proceed exactly as if no match was found.

### 2. Evaluate Results

**If match found (official skill exists):**

Present the finding to the user:

"**Ecosystem match found.**

**Existing skill:** {matched_skill_name} v{matched_version}
**Source:** {matched_source}
**Authority:** {official/community}
**Compatibility:** {compatibility_notes}

An existing skill already covers this source. You can:
- **[P] Proceed** — compile your own version anyway (useful for customization or different scope)
- **[I] Install** — install the existing skill instead of compiling
- **[A] Abort** — cancel this compilation"

**If no match found:**

Auto-proceed silently to next step. Do not display any message about the ecosystem check — absence of a match is the expected case.

**If timeout or error:**

Auto-proceed silently. Log a note in context: "Ecosystem check skipped (timeout/error) — proceeding with compilation."

### 3. Gate — Ecosystem Match (conditional)

This gate fires only when §2 found a match; on no match, timeout, or unavailable tool the step already auto-proceeded to `{nextStepFile}` with no menu.

**GATE [default: P]** — under `{headless_mode}` with a match, auto-proceed as [P], log "headless: ecosystem match found, auto-proceeding", and append `{step: "ecosystem-check", gate: "ecosystem-match", decision: "P", rationale: "headless mode — match found, auto-proceed with user's own compilation", timestamp: {ISO}}` to `headless_decisions[]` and, the moment it lands, append the same object as a JSON line to the durable audit sink `{sidecar_path}/auto-decisions.jsonl` (the on-landing append established at step 1 §3) — the sink feeds the evidence-report `## Auto-Decisions` table at step 5 §7 and step 6 §8.

Interactively, halt and wait for the user's choice on the §2 menu:

- **P** — proceed despite the existing skill; load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.
- **I** — display "Install the existing skill using: `[SF] Setup Forge → install {matched_skill_name}`", then halt (no extraction).
- **A** — display "Compilation aborted. Return to Ferris menu to select another action.", then halt.
- Any other question — answer it, then redisplay the menu.
