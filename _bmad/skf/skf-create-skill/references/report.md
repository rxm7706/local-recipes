# Step 8: Report

## STEP GOAL:

To display the final compilation summary — skill name, version, source, export count, confidence distribution, tier used, file list, and any warnings — and suggest next steps for the user.

## Rules

- Focus only on reporting compilation results — do not modify any files
- Deliver structured report with confidence breakdown
- Chains to the local health-check step via `{nextStepFile}` after completion (non-batch mode, or after the final batch brief) — the user-facing report is not the terminal step

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Display Forge Completion Banner

"**Skill forged: {name} v{version} — {export_count} functions, {primary_confidence} confidence.**"

Where `{primary_confidence}` is the predominant confidence tier (T1 if Forge/Deep, T1-low if Quick).

### 2. Display Compilation Summary

"**Compilation Summary**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Skill** | {name} v{version} |
| **Source** | {source_repo} @ {branch} ({commit_short}) |
| **Language** | {language} |
| **Forge Tier** | {tier} — {tier_description} |
| **Files Scanned** | {file_count} |
| **Exports Documented** | {documented_count} public API ({public_api_coverage}%) / {total_count} total ({total_coverage}%) |

**Confidence Distribution:**
| Tier | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| T1 (AST) | {t1_count} | Structurally verified via ast-grep |
| T1-low (Source) | {t1_low_count} | Inferred from source reading |
| T2 (QMD) | {t2_count} | QMD-enriched semantic context |
| T3 (External) | {t3_count} | Sourced from external documentation URLs |

**Output Files:**
- `{skill_package}/SKILL.md` — Active skill with trigger-based usage
- `{skill_package}/context-snippet.md` — Passive context snippet (used by export-skill)
- `{skill_package}/metadata.json` — Machine-readable birth certificate
- `{skill_package}/references/` — Progressive disclosure ({ref_count} files)
- `{forge_version}/provenance-map.json` — Source map with AST bindings
- `{forge_version}/evidence-report.md` — Build audit trail
- `{forge_version}/extraction-rules.yaml` — Reproducible extraction schema
- `{skill_group}/active` -> `{version}` — Symlink to current version"

### 3. Display Warnings (If Any)

If there were warnings from extraction, validation, or enrichment, display them:

"**Warnings:**
- {warning_1}
- {warning_2}
- ..."

If no warnings, omit this section entirely.

### 4. Suggest Next Steps

"**Recommended next steps:**
- **[TS] Test Skill** — verify completeness and accuracy before export
- **[EX] Export Skill** — publish to your skill library or agentskills.io
- **[US] Update Skill** — edit specific sections or add manual content

To use this skill immediately, add the context snippet to your CLAUDE.md:
```
{context_snippet_content}
```"

### 5. Batch Mode Status (If Applicable)

**If running in --batch mode:**

"**Batch progress:** {completed_count} of {total_count} skills compiled.

{If more remaining:} Proceeding to next brief: {next_skill_name}..."

Update the batch checkpoint in `{sidecar_path}/batch-state.yaml` with:

```yaml
batch_active: true
brief_list: [{full list of brief paths}]
current_index: {index of next brief to process, 0-based}
completed: [{list of completed skill names}]
last_updated: {ISO timestamp}
```

**Before writing:** validate the same two invariants that step 1 re-checks on resume — `0 <= current_index < len(brief_list)` AND `os.path.exists(brief_list[current_index])`. If either fails (e.g., the next brief file was deleted mid-batch, or arithmetic pushed the index off the end), set `batch_active: false` and write `batch_halt_reason: "invalid checkpoint at write time — index or file missing"` instead of the active record. The next run will re-discover rather than resume a broken index.

Then load and execute `references/load-brief.md` for the next brief. Step-01 detects an active batch via `batch-state.yaml` and loads the brief at `current_index` only after re-validating the same invariants (belt and braces — the checkpoint may have been edited between runs).

**If all batch briefs complete:**

Set `batch_active: false` in `{sidecar_path}/batch-state.yaml` to prevent stale state. Display: "Batch complete. {completed_count} skills compiled."

**If not batch mode:**

End workflow. No further steps.

### Result Contract

**If not batch mode (or all batch briefs complete):**

**Resolve the schema reference:** before writing, verify that `{project-root}/src/shared/references/output-contract-schema.md` exists and is readable. Try in order: `{project-root}/src/shared/references/output-contract-schema.md`, then `{project-root}/_bmad/skf/shared/references/output-contract-schema.md` (installed-forge path).

- **If resolved:** write the result contract per the schema — the per-run record at `{forge_version}/create-skill-result-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.json` (UTC timestamp, resolution to seconds) and a copy at `{forge_version}/create-skill-result-latest.json` (stable path for pipeline consumers — copy, not symlink). Include `SKILL.md`, `context-snippet.md`, `metadata.json`, **and `{forge_version}/evidence-report.md`** paths in `outputs` (the evidence report carries the `## Auto-Decisions` audit table where every silent auto-decision is recorded — pipeline consumers follow this path to audit the run) and confidence distribution in `summary`. Also set `summary.auto_decision_count` to the number of decision rows in the reconciled evidence-report `## Auto-Decisions` table (0 when the run was interactive and the section holds only the no-auto-decisions line) so a consumer can tell from the result JSON alone whether any gate auto-resolved. Count the persisted rows — the durable audit record step 6 §8 reconciled from disk — rather than the in-context `headless_decisions[]` length, so the count matches the table even if a long headless run compacted the buffer. Use `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {forge_version}/create-skill-result-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.json` (stdin-piped JSON) for the per-run record, then the same helper for the `-latest.json` copy.

- **If neither candidate path resolves:** skip the result-contract write entirely. Append a warning to `evidence-report.md`: "Result contract skipped — `shared/references/output-contract-schema.md` could not be resolved at either candidate path." Then set `validation_status: 'schema-unavailable'` in `metadata.json` (and re-write metadata.json via `skf-atomic-write.py write`). Pipeline consumers will observe the missing `-latest.json` and the metadata flag.

**Post-completion hook (optional).** After the result JSON and `metadata.json` are finalized, if `{onCompleteCommand}` is non-empty (resolved at SKILL.md On Activation §3 from `workflow.on_complete`), invoke it:

```bash
{onCompleteCommand} --result-path={forge_version}/create-skill-result-latest.json
```

Log success or failure to `workflow_warnings[]` but never fail the workflow on a hook error — the skill is already written and the result contract is final. The hook runs last so a git-add, registry registration, notifier, or downstream-skill chain sees a complete package. When `{onCompleteCommand}` is empty (bundled default), skip the invocation entirely.

### Result Contract on HARD HALT

The success-variant contract above is only reached at step 8. The ~10 HARD HALT conditions in steps 1–7 (forge-config missing, no brief, brief invalid, source not found, prerequisite failure in load-brief; atomic/detect/auth helper unresolved and the Tier-1 split-count drop in extract/validate; the non-symlink active-link refusal in generate-artifacts) otherwise print a human string and exit with **no machine-readable outcome** — a pipeline polling `create-skill-result-latest.json` cannot distinguish "halted at brief-invalid" from "still running" from "crashed". Mirror skf-quick-skill: **whenever `{headless_mode}` is true, every HARD HALT must surface an error-variant result before exiting.**

**For every HARD HALT under `{headless_mode}` (regardless of phase)** — emit a single line on **stderr** (one line, no pretty-print; matches the prefix-and-envelope convention used by `skf-emit-result-envelope.py`):

```
SKF_CREATE_SKILL_RESULT_JSON: {"status":"failed","phase":"<step-slug>","outputs":{},"summary":{"halt_reason":"<short class>","evidence_report":"<path-or-null>"},"skill_package":"<path-or-null>"}
```

Use `status: "partial"` instead of `"failed"` when artifacts were already staged or promoted before the HALT (i.e. the HALT fired at step 7 generate-artifacts after some files were written); use `"failed"` for HALTs before any artifact exists on disk (steps 1–6).

**Additionally, when `{forge_version}` is resolved** (HALT at step 7 onward, where the staging tree has been promoted) — write the same JSON object (without the `SKF_CREATE_SKILL_RESULT_JSON: ` prefix) to disk at `{forge_version}/create-skill-result-{YYYYMMDD-HHmmss}.json` and a copy at `{forge_version}/create-skill-result-latest.json` (copy, not symlink) via `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write`, so consumers that hardcode the `-latest.json` path see a deterministic file even on failed runs. Set `summary.evidence_report` to `{forge_version}/evidence-report.md` whenever that file exists, so the consumer can still reach the `## Auto-Decisions` audit on a failed run. HALTs before step 7 cannot write to disk because `{forge_version}` is only created at step 7 §1; for those, the stderr envelope is the contract and `summary.evidence_report` is `null`.

When `{headless_mode}` is false, HARD HALTs display their human message only — no envelope is emitted.

### 6. Chain to Health Check

**If not batch mode (or all batch briefs complete):**

Only after the compilation report, warnings (if any), recommended next steps, and result contract have been handled do you load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, and execute it. The health-check step is the true terminal step — do not stop here even though the report reads as final.

**If batch mode with remaining briefs:** Skip the health-check chain — load and execute `references/load-brief.md` for the next brief instead. The health check runs only after the final brief in the batch.
