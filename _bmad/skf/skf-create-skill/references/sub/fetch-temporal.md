# Step 3b: Fetch Temporal Context

## STEP GOAL:

To fetch temporal context (issues, PRs, changelogs, release notes) from the source repository and index it into a QMD collection for Deep tier enrichment. This ensures step 4 has historical data to search when annotating extracted functions with T2 provenance.

## Rules

- Deep tier only — Quick, Forge, and Forge+ tiers skip this step entirely and silently
- GitHub repositories only — other source types degrade gracefully
- Do not halt the workflow if fetching or indexing fails
- Do not modify extraction data from step 3 — this step only creates QMD collections

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

### 1. Check Eligibility

Evaluate the following conditions sequentially. **If ANY condition fails, skip silently to section 5 (auto-proceed) with no output:**

1. **Tier is Deep:** If tier is Quick, Forge, or Forge+, skip silently.
2. **Source is GitHub:** Verify `source_repo` is a GitHub URL (`https://github.com/...`) or `owner/repo` format. If the source is a local path, a non-GitHub URL, or any other format, attempt GitHub remote detection (section 1b) before skipping.
3. **`gh` CLI is available:** Run `timeout 10s gh auth status` to verify the CLI is installed and authenticated (the short timeout protects against a misconfigured network or hung auth helper blocking the workflow). If it fails or times out, skip silently.

All three conditions must pass to proceed to section 2.

### 1b. GitHub Remote Detection for Local Sources

**Only runs when condition 2 above fails because `source_repo` is a local path.**

Local repositories that are clones of GitHub repos contain temporal context (issues, PRs, releases) accessible via `gh`. Detect this automatically:

1. Check if the local path is a git repository: `git -C "{source_repo}" rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`
2. If not a git repo: skip silently to section 5 (current behavior).
3. Extract the origin remote: `git -C "{source_repo}" remote get-url origin`
4. If the remote URL contains `github.com`:
   - Extract `owner/repo` from the remote URL (strip `.git` suffix, handle both HTTPS and SSH formats)
   - Log: "**Local source with GitHub remote detected:** {owner}/{repo} — fetching temporal context."
   - Use the extracted `owner/repo` for all `gh` API calls in sections 3-4. Continue to condition 3 (gh CLI check).
5. If no remote, or remote is not GitHub: skip silently to section 5 (current behavior).

### 2. Check Cache (Skip If Fresh)

Read `forge-tier.yaml` from the sidecar path.

- Look for a `qmd_collections` entry where `skill_name` matches the current brief AND `type` is `"temporal"`.
- If found AND `created_at` is within the last **7 days** (rationale: temporal context — issues, PRs, changelogs — rarely changes meaningfully on shorter horizons; a 7-day window balances freshness against re-fetch cost and GitHub rate limits): the temporal collection is fresh. Display:

"**Temporal context: cached.** Collection `{skill-name}-temporal` is fresh ({days} days old). Skipping re-fetch."

Skip to section 5 (auto-proceed).

- If not found OR `created_at` is older than 7 days: continue to section 3.

### 3. Fetch Temporal Context

Create a staging directory: `_bmad-output/{skill-name}-temporal/`

Resolve the `owner` and `repo` from `source_repo` (e.g., `acme/toolkit` from `https://github.com/acme/toolkit`).

Execute the four fetches below **in parallel** — they are independent and the network round-trips dominate wall-clock. Background each, then `wait` for the batch. **If any individual fetch fails, log a warning and continue with the others.** The 4-concurrent fan-out is well under GitHub's authenticated REST rate limit (5000/hr); no bounded-concurrency guard is needed for this set.

```bash
mkdir -p {staging}
# 1. Issues (last 100)
( gh issue list -R {owner}/{repo} --state all --limit 100 \
    --json number,title,state,labels,createdAt,closedAt,body \
    | jq -r '...' > {staging}/issues.md ) &
# 2. Merged PRs (last 100)
( gh pr list -R {owner}/{repo} --state merged --limit 100 \
    --json number,title,mergedAt,labels,body \
    | jq -r '...' > {staging}/prs.md ) &
# 3. Release tags only (the per-tag fetch loop runs sequentially below to
#    preserve append-immediately crash-resume semantics for releases.md)
( gh release list -R {owner}/{repo} --limit 10 \
    --json tagName,name,publishedAt > {staging}/.release-tags.json ) &
# 4. Changelog (404 is silent skip — note `set +e` so the subshell doesn't
#    propagate `gh api`'s non-zero exit on missing file)
( set +e
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/CHANGELOG.md --jq '.content' \
    | base64 -d > {staging}/changelog.md 2>/dev/null
  [ -s {staging}/changelog.md ] || rm -f {staging}/changelog.md ) &
wait
```

Per-call rationale:

1. **Issues (last 100):** 100 is `gh issue list`'s default max-per-page; one paginated call captures recent activity without extra round trips or rate-limit pressure. Output → `{staging}/issues.md` formatted as a markdown document with one section per issue.

2. **Merged PRs (last 100):** Same 100-per-page convention as issues — captures the most recent merges in one API call. Output → `{staging}/prs.md`.

3. **Release tags + per-release fetches (last 10):** Release notes accumulate slowly relative to issues/PRs; the most recent 10 tags cover roughly the last 6-18 months of changelog-relevant history for typical OSS projects, which is enough context for T2-past annotations without fanning out to dozens of `gh release view` calls.

   **Note:** `gh release list --json` does **not** support the `body` field. The parallel block above fetches tags only (Step 1). After `wait`, run **Step 2 sequentially** to preserve the append-immediately crash-resume contract:

   If `{staging}/.release-tags.json` is empty (no releases), skip Step 2 and omit the releases section entirely. Otherwise:

   ```bash
   # Sequential per-tag loop. Iterate the JSON tag array verbatim so a
   # crash mid-loop leaves a partial-but-well-formed releases.md on disk.
   echo "# Releases (partial if interrupted)" > {staging}/releases.md
   ERR_FILE="{staging}/.gh-release-err"  # per-run stderr capture inside staging
   jq -r '.[].tagName' {staging}/.release-tags.json | while IFS= read -r tag; do
     if gh release view "$tag" -R {owner}/{repo} \
          --json tagName,name,publishedAt,body 2>"$ERR_FILE"; then
       jq -r '...' >> {staging}/releases.md  # one ## {tag} block per release
     else
       echo "## $tag — fetch failed: $(cat "$ERR_FILE")" \
         >> {staging}/releases.md
     fi
   done
   rm -f "$ERR_FILE"
   ```

   Failed individual fetches get a one-line placeholder; the loop continues with remaining tags. If a rate limit (HTTP 429) is hit, stop the release loop, keep the partial `releases.md` file in place (do not delete it), and log: "Release fetch stopped at tag {N}/{total} due to rate limiting — partial releases.md retained."

   **Why sequential here when the rest is parallel:** the append-per-release pattern guarantees that a mid-loop abort (rate limit, network drop, user interrupt) leaves a partial but well-formed `releases.md` with every release fetched so far. Parallel writers appending to the same file would need file locking and per-writer ordering — the simpler sequential loop is robust for free, and 10 release fetches contribute only ~5-10s of the total wall-clock.

4. **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` or `RELEASES.md` at the repository root. The parallel block above writes to `{staging}/changelog.md` only when the file exists; non-existence (404 from `gh api`) leaves no file behind.

#### 3b. Targeted Function Searches (Uses Extraction Inventory)

After the generic fetches above, perform **targeted searches** using the top-level public API function names from `extraction_inventory.top_exports[]`. This produces high-signal results that generic list fetches miss.

**Short-circuit on empty `top_exports`:** If `extraction_inventory.top_exports` is missing or `== []` (docs-only mode, or a source extraction that produced zero public exports), skip this sub-section entirely with a one-line log: "No exports in inventory — skipping targeted function searches." The generic fetches from §3 remain in place and continue to provide baseline temporal context.

**Limit:** Search the top **10 function names** maximum to control API call volume and avoid `gh` rate limiting. (rationale: 10 targeted searches + generic fetches from §3 stays well under GitHub's unauthenticated search rate limit of 10 requests/minute and authenticated 30/minute; matches the `top_exports[]` size emitted by step 3 §5 so every tracked export gets one search.)

For each function name in `top_exports[]` (up to 10), **sanitize first**: strip every character that is not in `[A-Za-z0-9_]` from `function_name` to produce `safe_name`. This prevents shell injection and `gh` query parser errors when an export name contains punctuation (e.g., `<T>`, `.method`, `::namespace`, quotes). If `safe_name` is empty after sanitization (the original was entirely punctuation — rare but possible for symbol exports), fall back to piping the original name through stdin via `--query-from-file -`-style indirection if your `gh` version supports it; otherwise skip that one entry with a log line — never substitute the unsanitized name back into the shell command.

**Parallel fan-out (bounded concurrency = 5):** sanitized searches are independent and benefit from parallelism. Use `xargs -P 5` so at most 5 `gh search` calls are in flight at once — this stays well under GitHub's authenticated search rate limit (30/min) while saving ~5-8s of wall-clock on a top-10 export list compared to fully sequential.

```bash
# 1. Sanitize and write one safe_name per line; skip empties.
#    Python is the canonical sanitizer because awk/sed regex semantics
#    vary across platforms.
jq -r '.top_exports[]' {extraction_inventory.json} \
  | python3 -c 'import sys,re
for line in sys.stdin:
  s = re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z0-9_]", "", line.strip())
  if s: print(s)' > {staging}/.safe-names.txt

# 2. Fan out to gh search, 5 in flight. Each writer emits a self-contained
#    section to its own per-name file; we concatenate after the wait.
# --limit 5: top-5 issues per function keeps signal-to-noise high and caps
#    total response size across 10 fan-outs at 50 issues.
mkdir -p {staging}/targeted
cat {staging}/.safe-names.txt | xargs -P 5 -I {} bash -c '
  gh search issues --repo {owner}/{repo} "{}" --limit 5 \
      --json number,title,state,body 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -r ". | \"## {}\\n\" + (...)" > {staging}/targeted/{}.md \
  || echo "## {} — fetch failed" > {staging}/targeted/{}.md
'

# 3. Concatenate in stable order (alpha by safe_name) into the single
#    aggregated file the rest of the workflow expects.
sort {staging}/.safe-names.txt | while IFS= read -r name; do
  cat "{staging}/targeted/$name.md"
done > {staging}/targeted-issues.md
```

Aggregate all targeted search results into a single file: `{staging}/targeted-issues.md`. The per-name temp directory `{staging}/targeted/` can be removed after concat — it exists only to give each parallel writer an isolated output stream.

**If `gh search` is unavailable** (older `gh` CLI versions): skip targeted searches silently. The generic fetches from section 3 still provide baseline temporal context.

**If rate limiting occurs** (HTTP 429 or similar): stop targeted searches immediately, keep results collected so far. Log: "Targeted search stopped at function {N}/{total} due to rate limiting."

**After all fetching,** verify at least one file was written to the staging directory. If the staging directory is empty (all fetches failed), log a warning and skip to section 5.

### 4. Index Into QMD & Register

**Index the staging directory:**

If a `{skill-name}-temporal` collection already exists, remove and recreate for atomic replace. **Wrap the remove + add pair with rollback on `add` failure** — a `remove` that succeeds followed by an `add` that fails must not leave the registry claiming a collection that no longer exists in QMD:

```bash
qmd collection remove {skill-name}-temporal
if ! qmd collection add {project-root}/_bmad-output/{skill-name}-temporal/ --name {skill-name}-temporal --mask "*.md"; then
  # add failed after remove succeeded — the collection is gone from QMD. Clean the registry too.
  # Remove any {skill-name}-temporal entry from forge-tier.yaml qmd_collections[].
  # Warn the user, do not fail the workflow (temporal enrichment degrades gracefully).
  echo "WARN: qmd add failed after remove — registry entry for {skill-name}-temporal removed to keep forge-tier.yaml consistent with QMD state."
  # [skip the embed step]
else
  qmd embed --collection {skill-name}-temporal
fi
```

**Rollback rule:** if the `qmd collection add` step fails (non-zero exit, network error, parse error) after the prior `remove` succeeded, remove the canonical registry entry in `forge-tier.yaml` to match QMD's actual state. A dangling registry entry that points at a non-existent QMD collection poisons subsequent cache-hit checks in §2. Emit a warning in evidence-report and skip the embed — enrichment degrades to no-QMD for this run.

**Scope the embed:** Always pass `--collection {skill-name}-temporal` to `qmd embed`. An unscoped `qmd embed` re-embeds every collection in the QMD store, which can take minutes per run in batch mode and generates wasteful GPU/API cost. If the installed `qmd` CLI does not accept `--collection` (older upstream versions), gate the embed behind a per-skill check: if a previous `{skill-name}-temporal` entry already exists in `qmd_collections` and its `created_at` is within 24 hours, skip the embed entirely and warn "qmd embed skipped — upstream qmd lacks --collection scope; re-embedding all collections would be wasteful in batch mode". Log the skip in the evidence report.

**Note:** `qmd embed` generates vector embeddings required for semantic (`type:'vec'`) and HyDE (`type:'hyde'`) sub-queries inside the QMD `query` tool. Without embeddings, only BM25 (`type:'lex'`) keyword search works. Run `qmd embed` after every `qmd collection add`.

**Update the registry** in `forge-tier.yaml` under a file lock to prevent concurrent batch runs from clobbering each other's entries:

1. Acquire an exclusive `flock` on `{sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml.lock` (create the lock file if absent). Use `flock -x {lockfile} -c "..."` or an equivalent `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` guard.
2. Read the current `forge-tier.yaml`, capturing its `st_mtime` as `mtime_before`.
3. Perform the read-modify-write below.
4. Write via `python3 {atomicWriteHelper} write --target {sidecar_path}/forge-tier.yaml`.
5. Release the flock.

**Fallback when `flock` is unavailable:** re-stat the file after the write; if the on-disk `st_mtime` is newer than `mtime_before` by more than this run's own write timestamp, halt with "forge-tier.yaml modified mid-update by another process — refusing to clobber. Re-run after the other run completes." This read-CAS-by-mtime is the belt-and-braces safety net for environments without `flock`.

If an entry with `name: "{skill-name}-temporal"` already exists in `qmd_collections`, replace it. Otherwise, append:

```yaml
  - name: "{skill-name}-temporal"
    type: "temporal"
    source_workflow: "create-skill"
    skill_name: "{skill-name}"
    created_at: "{current ISO date}"
```

**Clean up** the staging directory after successful indexing:

```bash
rm -rf {project-root}/_bmad-output/{skill-name}-temporal/
```

**Error handling:**

- If QMD indexing fails: log the error, note that temporal enrichment will be unavailable. Do not fail the workflow.
- If registry update fails: log the error, continue. The collection may exist in QMD even if the registry entry failed.
- If cleanup fails: log a warning and continue.

Display brief confirmation:

"**Temporal context indexed.** Collection `{skill-name}-temporal` created ({file_count} files: {list files}). Proceeding to enrichment..."

### 5. Auto-Proceed

No user interaction. After temporal context is fetched and indexed (or skipped for any reason — non-Deep tier, non-GitHub source, cache hit, or any failure), load `{nextStepFile}`, read it fully, then execute it.
