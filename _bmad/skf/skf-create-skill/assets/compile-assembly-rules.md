# SKILL.md Compilation Assembly Rules

## Frontmatter (agentskills.io compliance)

```yaml
---
name: {brief.name}
description: >
  {Trigger-optimized description from brief and extraction data.
  Include what it does, when to use it, and what NOT to use it for.
  1-1024 chars, optimized for agent discovery.}
---
```

**Frontmatter rules:**

- `name`: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only, must match the skill output directory name. Prefer gerund form (`processing-pdfs`, `analyzing-spreadsheets`) for clarity.
- `description`: non-empty, max 1024 chars, optimized for agent discovery. Use third-person voice ("Processes Excel files..." not "I can help you..." or "You can use this to...") and include a trigger phrase so agents know when to match — one of `Use when …`, `Triggers on …`, or `Reach for this when …`. When using `Use when `, follow with a **gerund** (`Use when building/processing/analyzing X…`) or a noun-phrase clause (`Use when the user requests to "X"`); never a bare indicative verb like `builds`/`processes`, because `skill-check --fix` will prepend a literal `Use when ` to a description missing the trigger phrase, producing ungrammatical output (`Use when builds X…`). Inconsistent point-of-view or a missing trigger phrase causes discovery problems since the description is injected into the system prompt. See `skf-brief-skill/assets/description-voice-examples.md` for the canonical voice palette.
- **The `description` cannot contain angle brackets** — neither standalone placeholders like `<name>`, `<component>`, `<path>`, nor inline generics like `` `Array<T>` `` or `` `Meta<typeof X>` ``. Both `skill-check`'s `description_field` validator and `tessl`'s deterministic description check parse the frontmatter description as a raw string and reject any `<` or `>`, regardless of markdown context (backticks do not protect content here). A rejected description fails the review with 0% score. When the natural phrasing would use angle brackets:
  - Prefer the curly-brace form in prose: `{name}`, `{component-id}`, `{path}` — readable and tessl-safe.
  - Uppercase placeholders are also acceptable: `NAME`, `COMPONENT_ID`.
  - For code-ish fragments, use curly braces in place of angle brackets inside the backticks: `` `Meta{typeof X}` ``, `` `Array{T}` ``.

  Authors should not rely on remembering this — step 5 §2a enforces it via a pre-write sanitization pass that unconditionally replaces every `<` with `{` and every `>` with `}` in the frontmatter `description`. See step 5 §2a for the rule and `assets/tessl-dismissal-rules.md` (`description-xml-tags-guarded-upstream`) for the recovery path if a downstream tool rewrites the description after §2a has run.
- Only `name` and `description` in frontmatter — `version` and `author` go in metadata.json
- No other frontmatter fields for standard skills (only `name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`, `allowed-tools` are permitted by spec)

## Two-Tier Assembly

**Two-tier assembly.** SKILL.md must retain actionable inline content that survives `split-body` extraction. Assemble Tier 1 sections first (always inline), then Tier 2 sections (reference-eligible, may be extracted by split-body).

### Tier 1 — Always Inline (must survive split-body)

These sections form the essential standalone body. Target: **under 300 lines total** for Tier 1. An agent loading only SKILL.md (without references) must get enough to act.

**Section 1 — Overview (~10 lines):**
- 1-line summary of what the library does
- Source repo, version, branch
- Forge tier used for compilation
- Export count and confidence summary

**Section 2 — Quick Start (~30 lines):**
- Select the 3-5 most commonly used functions (by import frequency or documentation prominence)
- One runnable code example showing a typical end-to-end flow (e.g., `add → process → search`)
- Minimal usage examples — ONLY from source tests or official docs
- If no examples exist in source, show signature-only quick start
- Provenance citation for each function

**Section 3 — Common Workflows (~30 lines):**
- 4-5 patterns showing typical function call sequences
- Each pattern: 1-line bold description + function call chain with key params
- Focus on the most common developer tasks, not exhaustive coverage
- Format example:
  ```
  **Add and process data:**
  `await cognee.add(data) → await cognee.cognify() → await cognee.search(query)`
  ```

**Section 4 — Key API Summary (~20 lines):**
- Table of top 10-15 functions: name, purpose, key parameters
- One row per function — no full signatures, just enough for discovery
- Provenance citation per function

**Section 4b — Migration & Deprecation Warnings (~10 lines, Deep tier only):**
- Only populated when step 4 enrichment produced **T2-future** annotations (deprecation warnings, breaking changes, planned renames)
- List each warning as a single-line bullet: function name, what changed or will change, source citation
- Max 10 lines — just the actionable warnings, not full context
- Link to Tier 2 Full API Reference for details: "See Full API Reference for migration details."
- **Skip entirely** for Quick/Forge tiers or when no T2-future annotations exist — do not emit an empty section
- This section survives split-body, ensuring agents always see critical migration context

**Section 5 — Key Types (~20 lines):**
- Most important enum/type definitions inline (e.g., SearchType values, config options)
- Only types that appear in Quick Start or Common Workflows
- Full type details go in Tier 2

**Section 6 — Architecture at a Glance (~10 lines):**
- Bullet list of major subsystem categories (e.g., "Graph DBs: Neo4j, Kuzu, Neptune")
- Adapter/driver overview — what's available, not how it works
- Skip for Quick tier or small libraries with < 5 modules

**Section 7 — CLI (~10 lines, if applicable):**
- Basic CLI commands if the library has a CLI interface
- Skip if no CLI exists

**Section 7b — Scripts & Assets (~10 lines, if applicable):**
- Manifest table of included scripts with filename, one-line purpose, and provenance citation
- Manifest table of included assets with filename, one-line purpose, and provenance citation
- Each entry: `scripts/{filename}` or `assets/{filename}`, purpose, `[SRC:{source_path}:L1]`
- Include a note: "Load scripts from `scripts/` and assets from `assets/` when directed by the instructions above."
- **Skip entirely** when no scripts or assets detected in extraction inventory — do not emit an empty section
- Like Sections 4b and 7, parsers must treat this section as optional

**Section 8 — Manual Sections:**
- Seed empty `<!-- [MANUAL] -->` markers:
```markdown
<!-- [MANUAL:additional-notes] -->
<!-- Add custom notes here. This section is preserved during skill updates. -->
<!-- [/MANUAL:additional-notes] -->
```
- Place after Quick Start and after Key API Summary sections

### Tier 2 — Reference-Eligible (can be extracted by split-body)

Assemble Sections 9-11 (Full API Reference, Full Type Definitions, Full Integration Patterns) as defined in the skill-sections data file. These contain full detail and are split into `references/` when the body exceeds 500 lines. Include T2 annotations from enrichment in the Full API Reference (Deep tier only).

**Tier 2 differentiation from Tier 1:** Tier 2 Full API Reference must contain content that is not present in Tier 1's Key API Summary. Specifically:

- **Full parameter tables** with types, defaults, and required/optional flags (Tier 1 only lists key params)
- **Return value details** including structure, types, and error conditions
- **T2 temporal annotations** — migration notes, deprecation details, breaking change context (Deep tier)
- **Usage examples** from source tests or documentation (Tier 1 has signature-only references)
- **Edge cases and constraints** — parameter validation rules, size limits, behavioral notes

Do not repeat Tier 1's name/purpose/key-params table format in Tier 2. Tier 2 is a deep reference, not a reformatted summary. This distinction prevents conciseness scorers from flagging the two-tier design as redundancy.

### Component Library Assembly Overrides

When `scope.type: "component-library"` in the brief AND `component_catalog[]` is available in context, apply these overrides to the standard assembly. All other sections remain unchanged.

**Section 2 (Quick Start) — CLI-first override:**

Replace the standard function-based Quick Start with CLI installation:

```markdown
## Quick Start

Install a component:
`npx {cli-name} add {top-component-id}`

{If provider wrapping detected in source:}
Set up providers:
\`\`\`tsx
import { ThemeProvider, UILibraryProvider } from "{primary-package}";

<ThemeProvider>
  <UILibraryProvider>
    <YourApp />
  </UILibraryProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
\`\`\`
```

Detect CLI name from: `package.json` `bin` field, README usage examples, or `registry_path` context. If no CLI detected, fall back to standard import-based Quick Start.

**Section 4 (Key API Summary) — Component Catalog override:**

Replace the function table with a Component Catalog organized by category:

```markdown
## Component Catalog

| Category | Count | Key Components |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| {category} | {count} | {top 3-5 component names, comma-separated} |

**Design system variants:** {variant list with primary marked}
**Total components:** {unique count} | {Per variant: **With {name}:** {count}}
```

Source: `component_catalog[]` from step 3d. Group by `category` field. Provenance: cite the registry file.

**Section 5 (Key Types) — Props-focused override:**

Replace generic types with the top 5 most-used Props interfaces (by component count or prominence):

```markdown
## Key Types

### {ComponentName}Props
| Prop | Type | Default | Required |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| {prop} | {type} | {default or —} | {yes/no} |
```

Show only the 5 most important Props interfaces inline. Full Props details go in Tier 2.

**Tier 2 (Full API Reference) — Props Reference override:**

Organize by component (not by function). Per component:

```markdown
### {ComponentName}

**Install:** `npx {cli} add {component-id}`
**Available in:** {variant list}
**Props:** `{ComponentName}Props`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| {prop} | {type} | {default} | {JSDoc description or —} |
```

**context-snippet.md — Component Library format:**

```markdown
[{name} v{version}]|root: skills/{name}/
|IMPORTANT: {name} v{version} — read SKILL.md before writing {name} code. Do NOT rely on training data.
|install: npx {cli} add <component-id>
|catalog:{SKILL.md#component-catalog} — {N} components: {category(count), ...}
|variants: {variant list} — {provider wrapping note if applicable}
|key-props:{SKILL.md#key-types} — {top props interfaces with key fields}
|gotchas: {detected gotchas}
```

**metadata.json — Component Library stats:**

When `scope.type: "component-library"`, add these fields to `stats`:

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "components_registered": 0,
    "components_documented": 0,
    "props_interfaces_extracted": 0,
    "components_unique": 0,
    "demo_files_excluded": 0,
    "design_variants": {}
  }
}
```

These are in addition to the standard stats fields (exports_documented, etc.).

### Reference-App Assembly Overrides

When `scope.type: "reference-app"` in the brief, apply these overrides to the standard assembly. The skill's value is an integration pattern (wiring), not a library surface — the default library-export template would force assemblers to remap wiring onto export slots and produce fuzzy counts. These overrides give that value a first-class home.

**Section 4 (Key API Summary) — Pattern Surface override:**

Replace the per-function table with an ordered list of wiring steps. Each step names a file, a surface (decorator, build field, lifecycle hook, config key), and a one-line description of what the user does there — not a function signature. The goal is that a reader copying the pattern can follow the list in order.

```markdown
## Pattern Surface

| # | File | Surface | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | {src/main.py} | {@app.startup decorator} | {brief wiring purpose} |
| 2 | {electron.vite.config.ts} | {build.copy field} | {brief wiring purpose} |
| … | … | … | … |
```

Source: the authored pattern surface from extraction + brief `scope.tier_a_include` (when present) or the curated provenance-map entries (when absent). Provenance: cite the originating source files.

**Section 3 (Common Workflows) — Adoption Steps override:**

Replace the function-call-chain format with copy-this-wiring narrative. Prefer numbered imperative steps that the user can execute in order, not an API-call sequence. Keep each step's code snippet minimal (5–15 lines) — full wiring lives in Tier 2.

```markdown
## Adoption Steps

1. **{Step name}** — {one-line description}
   ```{language}
   {minimal wiring snippet}
   ```
2. **{Step name}** — {one-line description}
   …
```

**Tier 2 (Full API Reference) — pattern-oriented override:**

Replace per-function subsections with `references/pattern-*.md` groupings: one reference file per coherent wiring concern (e.g. `pattern-lifecycle.md`, `pattern-build-config.md`, `pattern-ipc.md`). Each reference file covers every file/surface touched by that concern with full code snippets, gotchas, and provenance. Tier 1 (Pattern Surface) stays index-like; Tier 2 carries the copy-paste-able depth.

**metadata.json — Reference-App stats semantics:**

`stats.exports_documented` is a **library concept** and does not carry over cleanly. When `scope.type: "reference-app"`:

- `stats.exports_documented` MAY be set to the Pattern Surface row count as a proxy, but its semantics change: it counts authored pattern surfaces, not public exports. Emit an adjacent `stats.pattern_surfaces_documented` with the same integer so downstream consumers (test-skill, feasibility, discovery) can discriminate.
- `exports_public_api` / `exports_internal` / `exports_total` are not meaningful for a reference app — omit them, or set all three to the Pattern Surface count with a note in `stats.notes`: `"reference-app: export counts are pattern-surface proxies, not library exports"`.
- Do not fabricate signature / type-coverage data from pattern surfaces. skf-test-skill will skip those categories when metadata flags a reference-app (same skip path as `stackSkill` once that flag is wired — see scoring-rules.md).
- Do not emit `effective_denominator` for reference-app scope, even when the source is a monorepo. `effective_denominator` counts public exports from the authoring-surface barrel — a library concept that `pattern_surfaces_documented` already replaces here. A reference-app-in-monorepo literally satisfies `compile.md` §4's emit-conditions (monorepo + non-`full-library` + stratified `scope.notes`), so this carve-out takes precedence: pattern-surface coverage is the reference-app basis, and skf-test-skill skips library-export coverage for it.

**Language / spec-reference sub-shape:** A reference app that documents an engine- or spec-versioned **language** — a query language, grammar, or DSL (e.g. SurrealQL @ SurrealDB) whose value is construct idioms rather than wiring or exports — is a recognized reference-app sub-shape. Keep `scope.type: "reference-app"` (there is no separate enum value), so every carve-out above applies unchanged (`pattern_surfaces_documented` proxy, no `effective_denominator`, test-skill signature/type skip). Adapt the three overrides to the language's surface instead of app wiring:

- **Section 4 (Pattern Surface)** becomes a **construct-area map**, not a wiring list. Each row is a language construct area, where it lives in the source, and what the user writes there:

  ```markdown
  ## Pattern Surface

  | # | Construct Area | Where in Source | Purpose |
  |---|----------------|-----------------|---------|
  | 1 | {statements / DDL} | {sql::statements} | {what the user writes} |
  | 2 | {operators} | {sql::operator} | {…} |
  | … | … | … | … |
  ```

- **Section 3 (Adoption Steps)** becomes **production-task workflows** — ordered tasks a user performs *in the language* (define a schema, write a query, call a built-in function), each with a minimal snippet — not a copy-this-wiring narrative.
- **Tier 2** groups `references/*.md` by **language concern** (e.g. `statements.md`, `functions.md`, `types.md`) — one file per construct family — instead of `pattern-*.md` wiring concerns.
- **metadata.json:** `pattern_surfaces_documented` counts the documented construct areas; the no-`effective_denominator` carve-out applies (a language has no export barrel). The brief's `language` field records the **documented** language (e.g. `surrealql`), which may differ from the source language it was extracted from (e.g. `rust`) — see `skf-analyze-source/assets/skill-brief-schema.md`.

**When this clause does not apply:** `full-library`, `specific-modules`, `public-api`, `component-library`, or `docs-only`. Those scope types have their own assembly semantics and export-count conventions — do not mix.

### Whole-Language Reference Assembly Overrides

A **whole-language reference** is a compiler/interpreter repo (rustc, CPython, the Go toolchain, TypeScript) enriched with the language's canonical prose — the guide/Book and the standard/library docs. It maps to `scope.type: full-library`, but its value to a skill consumer is the **language**, not the compiler's internal exports. The standard library-export layout above would foreground compiler-internal signatures and bury the prose; these overrides invert that.

**GATE — apply ONLY when this is a whole-language reference.** The brief carries ≥1 `doc_urls` entry with `source: language-registry` (equivalently, `skf-derive-assembly-shape.py` returns `assembly_shape: "whole-language-reference"`). This is a structured, schema-validated signal — not a `scope.notes` substring — so an ordinary `full-library` library, a parser *library* (pest/lalrpop — its code IS the product, so §6b seeds no corpora), a component-library, a reference-app (including the language/spec-reference DSL sub-shape, which stays `scope.type: reference-app` and is handled by the reference-app override above), and a docs-only brief all fail the gate. When the gate does not fire, **skip this entire section** — the standard Tier 1 (sections 1–8) and Tier 2 (9–11) layout and the signature-fidelity rule run unchanged, so non-whole-language skills assemble byte-identically.

When the gate fires, the assembler has a `language_guide[]` artifact from step 3c §4a (the retained corpora prose, carved out of the T3-vs-T1 conflict rule). Apply these overrides:

**Empty-guide guard (check first):** If `language_guide[]` is absent or every entry's `prose` is null (all registry corpora failed to fetch), do not emit a thin Language Guide above a full internals section — fall back to the standard layout and record a warning in `evidence-report.md`: "Whole-language reference gated but no Language-Guide prose was retained — assembled as a standard library skill." This prevents the inverse-value outcome (prose section empty, compiler internals dominant).

**New Section 1b — Language Guide (Tier 1, foregrounded):** Immediately after Section 1 (Overview) and BEFORE Quick Start, emit the skill's primary content from `language_guide[]`. One subsection per corpus (`{label}`), carrying the retained prose — language concepts, idioms, and usage examples — each block cited `[EXT:{url}]`. This is the section an agent reads to learn the language; it survives split-body as Tier 1.

**Section 2 (Quick Start) — language-usage override:** Build the runnable examples from the Language-Guide prose (writing and running code *in* the language — a minimal program, a common idiom), cited `[EXT:{url}]`, not from compiler-internal export call chains. Fall back to the standard signature-only Quick Start only if the guide yields no examples.

**Section 3 (Common Workflows) — "Writing {language}" override:** Replace function-call-chain workflows over compiler exports with common language tasks (define a type, handle errors, organize a module), each a short idiom from the guide.

**Section 4 (Key API Summary) — demote compiler internals:** Replace the top-of-body compiler-export function table with a one-paragraph "Standard Library & Language Surface" pointer into the Language Guide. Move the AST/compiler-internal exports into a late-ordered Tier 2 subsection `### Compiler Internals (reference only)` with a one-line note: "Internal implementation surface of the {language} toolchain — most consumers want the Language Guide above, not these."

**Signature fidelity is preserved (not relaxed):** this is an ordering/prominence change only. Any compiler signatures that DO appear (in Compiler Internals) keep their T1/AST-authoritative params and return types per Section 1b of `compile.md` and rule 7 below. The override never substitutes prose-derived signatures for AST-extracted ones; it changes which content leads, not which tier wins a per-export signature conflict.

**metadata.json:** the skill stays `scope.type: full-library`; export-count stats are still emitted. (A whole-language skill's low public-API coverage versus the full compiler surface is expected — coverage-gate semantics for this shape are tracked separately and out of scope here.)

### Assembly Rules

1. Assemble all Tier 1 sections first — these form the essential standalone body
2. Assemble all Tier 2 sections after — these are progressive disclosure detail
3. Tier 1 content stays under 300 lines (excluding frontmatter)
4. If Tier 1 alone exceeds 300 lines, reduce Key API Summary and Architecture at a Glance
5. Tier 1 sections are kept short enough that `split-body` targets the larger Tier 2 sections (`## Full ...` headings) instead
6. After split-body, SKILL.md must still contain all Tier 1 sections with actionable content
7. **Signature fidelity:** When populating function entries from the extraction inventory, always use the `params` and `return_type` fields from the provenance-map entry (T1/AST-backed). Do not substitute parameter names, types, or return types from documentation, README examples, or enrichment annotations. T2/T3 sources may enrich descriptions and add usage notes, but structural signature data from AST extraction is authoritative.

### Reference File Rules

- **Table of contents required** for any reference file exceeding 100 lines — include a `## Contents` section at the top listing all sub-sections. This ensures agents can see the full scope even when previewing with partial reads.
- One file per major function group or type — group by module, file, or functional area
- Name files descriptively: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`

### Content Quality Rules

These SKF-specific rules apply to all content assembled in SKILL.md and reference files. Generic authoring craft — matching instruction freedom to task fragility, consistent terminology, avoiding time-sensitive instructions, progress checklists for multi-step workflows, and the plan-validate-execute pattern for batch/destructive operations — is assumed and not re-taught here. Only the two rules below encode a non-obvious SKF constraint or downstream-validator quirk that an author would not otherwise infer.

**Zero-hallucination examples:** Include input/output or usage examples ONLY when concrete pairs exist in source tests or official docs — 2-3 such pairs convey the desired style and detail more clearly than a description alone. If no examples exist in source, note the gap rather than fabricating pairs — zero hallucination applies.

**Generic-plus-signature code spans:** When documenting a generic class constructor or factory signature, do not place the generic brackets and the parameter list inside a single inline code span. `skill-check`'s `links.local_markdown_resolves` validator parses `` `ClassName[T](key: str)` `` as a broken markdown link (`[T]` becomes the link text, `(key: str)` becomes the URL) and emits a `broken local link` warning on the Links axis, regardless of the surrounding backticks. This applies to Tier 1 Key Types, Tier 2 Full API Reference, and reference files. Safe alternatives:
- Split into two code spans: `` `ClassName[T]` — dataclass with fields `(key: str, value: int)` ``
- Drop the explicit constructor and describe fields in prose: `` `ClassName[T]` — generic container parameterized by `T`, with field `key: str` ``
- Use the curly-brace substitution used for frontmatter: `` `ClassName{T}(key: str)` `` (readable, avoids both markdown-link and angle-bracket parsing)
