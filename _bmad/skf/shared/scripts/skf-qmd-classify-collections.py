"""SKF QMD Classify Collections — Set arithmetic over QMD collection names.

Replaces the prose-driven classification logic in `src/skf-setup/references/
auto-index.md` §3 with one Python invocation. Compares the live
QMD collections (from `qmd collection list`) against the forge registry
(`qmd_collections` array in forge-tier.yaml) and classifies each name as
Healthy / Orphaned / Stale, applying the forge-namespace suffix filter
added in PR #244 to silently exclude collections owned by unrelated
tools sharing the QMD daemon.

Classification rules (per step 3 §3):

  Healthy   — name in {forge-suffix-matched live} AND in registry.
              No action needed.
  Orphaned  — name in {forge-suffix-matched live} but NOT in registry.
              Flagged for user-prompted removal in step 3 §4.
  Stale     — name in registry but NOT in {all live}. Registry entry
              should be removed.
  Foreign   — name in live but does NOT match a forge suffix. Silently
              excluded from every classification — never displayed,
              never proposed for removal. Reported as a count for
              telemetry only.

Forge suffixes (the only suffixes a forge-managed collection can have,
set by producers `skf-brief-skill` and `skf-create-skill` per
src/knowledge/qmd-registry.md § Collection Types):

  -brief, -temporal, -docs, -extraction

Inputs:

  --live-names    Comma-separated list of collection names currently
                  in QMD (caller obtains this from `qmd collection list`
                  before invoking the script). Empty string → no live
                  collections, which is a valid first-run state.

  --registry-from-yaml <path>
                  Path to forge-tier.yaml. The script reads the file's
                  `qmd_collections` array and extracts the `name` field
                  from each entry. Missing file or missing array → empty
                  registry, which is a valid first-run state.

Output (single JSON document on stdout):

  {
    "status": "ok",
    "version": "v1",
    "healthy":          ["foo-brief", "foo-extraction"],
    "orphaned":         ["bar-extraction"],
    "stale":            ["baz-docs"],
    "foreign_filtered_count": 4,
    "foreign_filtered_sample": ["memory-root-1", "sessions-2"]
  }

`foreign_filtered_sample` is capped at 5 names (telemetry; the full list
is never useful — if it were forge-relevant it would have a forge suffix).

CLI — invoke via `uv run` so the PEP 723 PyYAML dependency declared
above is auto-resolved on first call and cached. `docs/getting-started.md`
documents uv as the runtime prerequisite for exactly this. Bare
`python3` will fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`
on a fresh interpreter:

  uv run skf-qmd-classify-collections.py \\
      --live-names foo-brief,foo-extraction,memory-root-1 \\
      --registry-from-yaml /path/forge-tier.yaml

Exit codes:
  0 success
  1 user error (bad args, malformed registry file)
  2 internal error
