# CCC Bridge

## Principle

`ccc_bridge.*` references in workflow steps are **conceptual interfaces**, not callable functions. They describe a semantic code discovery operation to perform. Use the `ccc` MCP server tools (when available) or `ccc` CLI commands to execute these operations. See the TOOL/SUBPROCESS FALLBACK rule — if ccc is unavailable, the calling step falls back to direct ast-grep or source reading without ccc pre-discovery. For the complete bridge-to-tool resolution table covering all IDE environments, see [tool-resolution.md](tool-resolution.md).

## Rationale

Without ccc pre-discovery, extraction steps scan all source files uniformly — processing them in directory order or entry-point-first order. On large codebases (500+ files), this means AST extraction in CLI streaming mode uses `head -N` cutoffs that may miss relevant exports in files that appear late in the scan. Integration detection in Stack Skill relies on grep-based co-import counting, which misses semantic relationships between libraries that don't appear in the same file.

With ccc pre-discovery:
- Extraction steps receive a relevance-ranked file queue — the most semantically important files are processed first, before any streaming cutoff
- Integration detection gains semantic augmentation — pairs below the 2-file co-import threshold can be evaluated via natural language queries
- Audit workflows can detect renamed/moved exports via semantic search before classifying them as deleted

The key architectural constraint: ccc discovers, ast-grep verifies. Discovery method is orthogonal to confidence tier. This keeps the 4-tier confidence system (T1/T1-low/T2/T3) clean and avoids tier proliferation.

## When ccc Is Used

ccc is a **discovery layer only**. It answers "where should I look?" — it does not produce citations or structural claims. Every path or symbol returned by ccc_bridge must be verified by `ast_bridge` (T1) or source reading (T1-low) before it enters the extraction inventory. ccc results never appear in provenance citations.

ccc is **required** at the Forge+ tier (it defines Forge+) and **optionally available** at the Deep tier as an enhancement (when `tools.ccc: true` in forge-tier.yaml).

## Availability

ccc_bridge operations are available when:
- `tools.ccc: true` in forge-tier.yaml (verified by `ccc --help` + `ccc doctor` in setup)
- `ccc_index.status` is `"fresh"` or `"stale"` in forge-tier.yaml (an index exists for the project)

When either condition is false, calling steps skip ccc discovery silently and proceed with direct ast-grep or source reading. This is standard Forge tier behavior — not a degradation.

## Operations

### `ccc_bridge.search(query, path?, top_k?)`

**Resolves to:** `cd {path} && ccc search --limit {top_k} "{query}"` (CLI) or the `ccc` MCP search tool (preferred). Note: `ccc search` operates on the index in the current working directory — there is no flag to specify a project directory. The `--path` flag is a file path glob filter within the index, not a project selector.

Returns: list of `{file, score, snippet}` entries ranked by semantic relevance to the query. These are **candidates** for ast-grep extraction — not verified exports.

**Usage context:** Called before ast-grep in Forge+ and Deep tier extraction steps to discover semantically relevant source regions. Results pre-rank the file extraction queue so ast-grep processes the most relevant files first.

### `ccc_bridge.ensure_index(path)`

**Resolves to:** Check `ccc_index.status` in forge-tier.yaml. If `"none"` or the indexed_path does not match, run `cd {path} && ccc init` then `ccc index` and update forge-tier.yaml. Note: `ccc init` takes no positional arguments — it initializes the index for the current working directory.

**Usage context:** Called by setup step 1b to ensure the project root is indexed. Called lazily by extraction steps when `ccc_index.status` is `"none"` but ccc is available.

### `ccc_bridge.status()`

**Resolves to:** Two-step verification:
1. `ccc --help` — confirms binary exists (exit 0) AND output contains the `CocoIndex Code` identity marker (rejects unrelated `ccc`-named binaries shadowing PATH)
2. `ccc doctor` — confirms daemon is running, extracts version string, validates embedding model

**Usage context:** Called exclusively by setup step 1 during tool detection. Downstream workflows read the result from forge-tier.yaml — they do not re-verify.

## Confidence

ccc discovery does not produce a confidence tier. The provenance chain is:

1. ccc discovers candidate files (internal hint — not cited)
2. ast-grep verifies exports in those files → **T1** citation `[AST:file:Lnn]`
3. Or source reading verifies → **T1-low** citation `[SRC:file:Lnn]`

The ccc search is invisible in the output artifact. A Forge+ skill's citations are indistinguishable from a Forge skill's citations — the difference is in extraction coverage, not citation format.

## Indexing Lifecycle

### When Indexing Happens

1. **setup step 1b:** Indexes the project root when setup runs. This is the primary indexing point.
2. **Workflow discovery steps:** If `ccc_index.status` is `"stale"` or `"none"`, discovery steps trigger a re-index and warn the user. They do not block.
3. **ccc daemon:** Incremental indexing means re-indexing unchanged files is a near-no-op.

### Freshness

- Staleness threshold: 24 hours (configurable via `ccc_index.staleness_threshold_hours` in forge-tier.yaml)
- A stale index still produces useful results — the workflow proceeds with the stale index and notes the staleness
- setup is the designated refresh authority

### Exclusion Patterns

CCC stores its configuration at `{project-root}/.cocoindex_code/settings.yml`. This file contains `exclude_patterns` and `include_patterns` arrays in glob format. `ccc init` creates the file with sensible defaults (excludes `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, hidden dirs, etc.).

**SKF infrastructure exclusions:** setup step 1b appends SKF-specific exclusion patterns after `ccc init` creates the default config. These patterns prevent indexing of framework and output directories that have zero value for source extraction:

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `**/_bmad` | SKF framework module (workflow instructions, agents, knowledge) |
| `**/_bmad-output` | Build output artifacts (TODO files, reports) |
| `**/.claude` | Claude Code configuration |
| `**/_skf-learn` | SKF learning materials |
| `**/{skills_output_folder}` | Generated skill files (from manifest, default: `skills`) |
| `**/{forge_data_folder}` | Compilation workspace (from manifest, default: `forge-data`) |

The `skills_output_folder` and `forge_data_folder` values are resolved from the workflow activation context (sourced from `_bmad/skf/config.yaml`), falling back to the defaults `skills` and `forge-data`. Patterns are appended only if not already present — user customizations to `settings.yml` are preserved.

The configured exclusion patterns are stored in `ccc_index.exclude_patterns` in forge-tier.yaml for reference.

### Deferred Discovery (Remote Sources)

For remote repository sources (GitHub URLs), CCC cannot operate during step 2b because no local code exists yet. The workspace clone or ephemeral clone happens in step 3. To provide CCC pre-ranking for remote sources:

1. **step 2b:** Detects remote source, sets `{ccc_discovery: []}`, displays deferred message
2. **step 3:** After source resolution succeeds, detects the deferred scenario (`tools.ccc == true AND {ccc_discovery} is empty AND remote_clone_path is set AND tier is Forge+/Deep`)
3. **step 3 (workspace fast path):** If `{remote_clone_path}/.cocoindex_code/` already exists (persisted workspace index), skips init/index and uses `ccc search --refresh` — CCC daemon re-indexes only if files changed since last index. This is near-instant for unchanged repos.
4. **step 3 (first-time path):** If no existing CCC index, runs `cd {remote_clone_path} && ccc init`, applies standard build/dependency exclusions (node_modules, dist, .git, vendor, etc.) to `settings.yml`, then runs `ccc index`. Brief-specific `include_patterns`/`exclude_patterns` are NOT written to `settings.yml` — the CCC index is general-purpose. Filtering happens at search result time.
5. **step 3:** Executes CCC search and populates `{ccc_discovery}` before AST extraction begins

For workspace repos, the CCC index persists at `{workspace_repo_path}/.cocoindex_code/` and is reused across forges, projects, and sessions. For ephemeral fallback clones, the index is not registered in `ccc_index_registry` — the clone is deleted after extraction.

### Relationship to QMD Registry

ccc_index and qmd_collections are **orthogonal**:
- `ccc_index` in forge-tier.yaml tracks the persistent source code index (one per project)
- `qmd_collections[]` in forge-tier.yaml tracks per-skill workflow artifact collections
- ccc indexes source code for semantic search; QMD indexes curated artifacts for temporal/knowledge search
- The janitor role for QMD (setup step 3) operates independently of ccc_index

## Query Volume Bounds

To prevent excessive daemon calls, workflow steps cap ccc queries:
- **create-skill extraction:** max 2 queries per skill (discovery + optional scope refinement)
- **analyze-source mapping:** max 1 query per qualifying unit
- **create-stack-skill integration detection:** max 1 query per library pair
- **audit-skill re-index:** max 1 query per export missing from its recorded location

## Anti-Patterns

- Using ccc_bridge results as citations without ast-grep verification — ccc output is never a provenance citation
- Blocking a workflow because ccc is unavailable — ccc is always optional
- Running ccc_bridge.ensure_index() without checking ccc_index.status first — unnecessary re-indexing
- Passing ccc results directly to the extraction inventory — they are candidates, not extractions
- Listing ccc as "unavailable" in reports for Quick/Forge tiers — ccc is a Forge+ capability, not something Quick/Forge tiers are missing
- Indexing without configuring exclusions — for project root indexes, apply SKF exclusions (framework/output directories); for workspace repo indexes, apply standard build artifact exclusions (node_modules, dist, .git, etc.)
- Writing brief-specific `exclude_patterns` to a workspace repo's `settings.yml` — workspace indexes are general-purpose and serve multiple briefs. Apply brief patterns at search result time, not index time. (Exception: ephemeral fallback clones are single-use, so brief exclusions may be applied to their `settings.yml` to reduce indexing time.)
- Skipping CCC discovery for remote sources without deferring to step 3 — remote repos deserve the same pre-ranking as local sources
