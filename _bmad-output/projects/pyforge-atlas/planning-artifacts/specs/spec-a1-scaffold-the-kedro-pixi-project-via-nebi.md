## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story A1 (2.1): Scaffold the Kedro + pixi project via `nebi`

As the operator,
I want the Kedro project structure and pixi wiring initialized by `nebi` with its own lean env and `kedro-test` gate,
So that every later story lands in a provisioned, verifiable, worktree-affordable project.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story A1, binding)

**Given** the FR-15 stack already resolved in the `local-recipes` env
**When** `nebi` scaffolds the project
**Then** a Kedro project skeleton exists, scaffolded by `nebi`
**And** the FR-15 stack resolves at its pins on Python 3.14 (all conda-forge, no standalone binaries / JVM) and `pixi run` activates cleanly
**And** `pixi run -e local-recipes llms-full-check` passes after any dependency change (library catalog updated in the same PR)
**And** air-gapped provisioning is documented for both routing layers (`.pixi/config.toml [pypi-config]` and the `_http.py` overrides)
**And** the scaffolded project ships its own lean pixi env (loop worktrees never materialize the fat `local-recipes` env) and the `kedro-test` verify task — Wave A's deterministic gate — including the import smoke for py3.14-unclassified glue (e.g. `kedro_dagster`, AD-16)
**And** *(correct-course 2026-07-17)* the scaffold root is `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` — a pixi build workspace member mirroring `pyforge-warden` (hatchling; dual conda + wheel/sdist artifacts; dedicated `[feature.pyforge-atlas]` env + `pyforge-atlas-build-conda`/`-build-dist` tasks)
**And** *(correct-course 2026-07-17)* the Python package is the `pyforge.atlas` namespace package (`src/pyforge/atlas/`, imports `pyforge.atlas.*` beside `pyforge.warden.*`); `kedro-test`'s import smoke covers the Kedro-project-in-namespace-package seam, with flat `pyforge_atlas` as the recorded fallback if nebi/Kedro tooling rejects the dotted form
**And** *(correct-course 2026-07-17)* `pyforge-warden` is wired as the optional extra `pyforge-atlas[gate]` — the only cross-package code dependency (ComplianceReport schema/validators, consumed at F4); installed in the atlas env by default; no reverse warden→atlas import exists (both tools stay independently installable).

- **FRs:** FR-15.
- **Invariants:** AD-16, AD-11 (gate is a named story deliverable), AD-18, Packaging & namespace convention (warden-aligned — Spine Deferred slot RESOLVED 2026-07-17).
- **Mode:** DEV-AUTO (harness-building, § 2.5).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** **builds `kedro-test`**.
- **Depends on:** 0.1.

### Story A2 (2.2): Define the Data Catalog for all sources + outputs

As a pipeline node author,
I want every API source and Parquet output declared as a Kedro dataset in `conf/base/catalog.yml`,
So that no data-access logic ever lives in node functions and credentials scope per host.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story A2, binding)

**Given** the legacy `_http.py` / `init_schema()` data-access surface
**When** the catalog is authored
**Then** all current data access is represented declaratively in `catalog.yml`
**And** no data-access logic remains inline in (future) node functions
**And** a `kedro-catalog-check` verify task exists (catalog resolves, no inline IO) — a § 2.5 loop gate — shipping the AD-1 import-direction meta-test
**And** credentials attach per destination host only (a non-JFrog host never receives `X-JFrog-Art-Api`) and all 20 `resolve_*_urls` override points survive as dataset-level endpoint config (FR-1 consequences).

- **FRs:** FR-1.
- **Invariants:** AD-2, AD-1 (meta-test), AD-13 (endpoint override convention).
- **Mode:** DEV-AUTO (harness-building, § 2.5).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** **builds `kedro-catalog-check`**.
- **Depends on:** A1.

### Story A3 (2.3): Implement `IncrementalParquetDataset` for TTL gating

As a pipeline node author,
I want the `*_fetched_at` TTL incremental logic encapsulated in one reusable dataset class with per-dataset TTLs,
So that no node ever re-implements checkpoint/TTL/backoff and resumability is Kedro-native.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story A3, binding)

**Given** the catalog from A2
**When** `IncrementalParquetDataset` is implemented
**Then** it exists and round-trips TTL state
**And** a unit test proves stale rows are re-fetched and fresh rows are skipped
**And** TTLs are declared per dataset in the catalog (Phase D 7 d, Phase P 30 d, EPSS 1 d, CWE 90 d, …) — never a global constant (FR-3).

- **FRs:** FR-3, FR-4 (the dataset class is the resumability primitive).
- **Invariants:** AD-5, AD-18 (this story validates the worktree symlink bootstrap and measures worktree env-materialization cost), AD-11.
- **Mode:** LOOP-S — **the designated first loop-driven story and worktree smoke** (§ 2.5 preconditions).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** `kedro-test` (unit suite; also proves the loop-in-worktree seam before Wave B commits to loop execution).
- **Depends on:** A1, A2.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
