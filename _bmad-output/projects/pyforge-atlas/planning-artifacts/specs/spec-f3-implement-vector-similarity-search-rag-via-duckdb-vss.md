## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story F3 (7.3): Implement Vector Similarity Search (RAG) via DuckDB `vss`

As a CFE authoring agent,
I want RAG embeddings + similarity search via DuckDB's `vss` extension,
So that semantic retrieval over embedded artifacts runs in the same single engine.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story F3, binding)

**Given** embedded artifacts in the DuckDB store
**When** a similarity query runs
**Then** it returns ranked results from DuckDB via `vss`
**And** the embedding model/strategy and offline `vss` extension provisioning (default network `INSTALL` collides with AD-13 for the consumer profile) are resolved in this story's spec (Spine Deferred).

- **FRs:** FR-5.
- **Invariants:** AD-4, AD-13 (offline provisioning tension — must resolve, not ignore).
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none (embedding strategy is a story-spec decision).
- **Verify gate:** `kedro-test` (ranked-results fixture).
- **Depends on:** F1 (consolidated store).

### Story F4 (7.4): Dependency-hygiene node + unified CI policy gate

As CI,
I want the deptry hygiene node and the converged four-axis policy gate as the Universal SBOM pipeline's terminal stage,
So that one schema-validated `ComplianceReport` and one frozen exit code replace CLI scraping.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story F4, binding)

**Given** the B7 SBOM pipeline and the F2 validation machinery
**When** the hygiene node + policy gate land
**Then** an injected unused-dependency fixture yields a schema-valid hygiene finding in the `ComplianceReport` artifact (source-less inputs report `not-applicable`, never failure — FR-16)
**And** a policy breach (e.g. `max_critical=0` violated, or a KEV-affecting-current hit) exits with the frozen contract codes (1 policy-fail / 2 error), halts Dagster, and raises an A2A alert — identical failure semantics to an FR-10 violation
**And** the assembled report validates against the four-axis `ComplianceReport` schema (hygiene + security populated; license/currency from atlas-native data or `not-applicable`), with the F4 terminal node as the single producer (AD-12)
**And** the `inventory-match` exit-code flip lands with its one-release deprecation window (`INVENTORY_MATCH_LEGACY_EXIT=1`); CI consumers see the frozen convention
**And** the report schema matches `pyforge-warden.md`'s `ComplianceReport` **by import** *(correct-course 2026-07-17)* — the gate node validates against `pyforge.warden`'s schema module via the `pyforge-atlas[gate]` extra, never a vendored copy (AD-12 schema-by-import); absent the extra, the gate node fails with an explicit install hint while all other pipelines run (independence preserved) — so the planned promotion (MCP tool + pixi CLI) requires no schema change.

- **FRs:** FR-16, FR-18, FR-10.
- **Invariants:** AD-12 (single producer; scope split; degradation-vocabulary mapping), AD-9, AD-20, AD-15.
- **Mode:** LOOP-S (unattended assumption — see Decisions § D-6: the exit-code flip + frozen convention warrant per-story spec approval).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** `kedro-test` (schema fixtures + exit-code fixtures + `not-applicable` fixture).
- **Depends on:** B7 (intake + matcher), F2 (validation machinery).

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.

## Dev narrative — recovered from the merged record (2026-07-25)

### Dev summary — merged PR #94: story(F3): DuckDB vss vector similarity search (RAG) (FR-5)

## Summary

Adds `rag/` — semantic retrieval over embedded artifacts in the **same single engine** (AD-4). `similarity_search` embeds the query with an injectable, offline, deterministic feature-hash embedder (hashlib — stable across processes; a learned model is the **DW-F3-1** upgrade) and ranks with an **exact** DuckDB `ORDER BY array_distance(emb, ?) LIMIT k` — distance computed + sorted IN DuckDB, never numpy/faiss. AD-4 vector-engine import-ban (faiss/hnswlib/chroma/qdrant banned). The `vss` HNSW index is the scale structure whose *creation* requires the vss extension.

**AD-13 offline provisioning resolved:** the consumer path only `LOAD`s vss from the pre-provisioned local cache via an injectable loader, raising a clear `VssNotProvisionedError` when absent — never a silent network `INSTALL` (that lives only in the explicit attended `provision_vss`, **DW-F3-2**).

## Review fixes (both in-loop reviewers, substantive)

- **Persistent-connection break:** the store now `SET`s `hnsw_enable_experimental_persistence` so `index()` + `similarity_search` work on a **persistent (on-disk) connection** — the F1 consolidated store F3 is designed to ride, which every prior test masked with in-memory (`CREATE INDEX ... HNSW` raised `BinderException` on-disk). Regression test on a file-backed connection.
- **SQL identifier injection:** `table`/`metric` constructor args validated as bare SQL identifiers (interpolated into DDL by name; a value smuggling a second statement could DROP a table). Regression test proves injection is rejected pre-execution.
- **Honest docstrings:** the shipped query is an **exact** seq-scan + top-n (the `id` tiebreak keeps it exact, so it does not use the HNSW index); vss is load-bearing at the store/index level, not the exact query — no false acceleration claim.

## Tests

`666 passed` (+21 new).
