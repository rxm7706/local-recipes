## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story C2 (4.2): Integrate `kedro-viz` + expose a pixi task

As the operator,
I want the topological DAG rendered by `kedro-viz` behind a dedicated pixi task,
So that I inspect dataset schemas and lineage in the browser instead of reading orchestrator source.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story C2, binding)

**Given** the compiled DAG
**When** `pixi run viz` executes
**Then** it launches the Kedro-Viz server
**And** operators can inspect dataset schemas + data lineage in the browser.

- **FRs:** FR-6 (structural observability), whole-migration AC-3.
- **Invariants:** AD-1, AD-6.
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none (Q2 drained at C1).
- **Verify gate:** `dagster-dryrun` + `kedro-test` (existing gates; viz task smoke lands in the pixi task inventory).
- **Depends on:** C1.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.

## Dev narrative — recovered from the merged record (2026-07-25)

> The original spec's `## Dev Notes` / `## Review Triage Log` were lost with the Tier-3
> worktree teardown (this story was built in claude.ai/code web session
> `01FYyQvBJuXwySiaMUUYCqBZ`; see `README.md`). The narrative below is reconstructed from
> the **authoritative merged record** — the story's PR body and its commits on `main` —
> **not** a regeneration. If the verbatim original is recovered from the web session, it
> supersedes this section.

### Dev summary — merged PR #85: story(C2): integrate kedro-viz behind a pixi `viz` task (FR-6 / AC-3)

## Summary

Exposes the migrated Kedro DAG to Kedro-Viz behind `pixi run viz`, so operators inspect dataset schemas + data lineage in the browser instead of reading orchestrator source. Closes Wave C.

- **`viz` pixi task** — `kedro viz run --no-browser`, `cwd = src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas` (the kedro CLI needs the project root as cwd so it renders *this* project's DAG).
- **Offline smoke** (`tests/orchestration/test_viz_loadable.py`) — asserts Kedro-Viz's own `load_data` builds the atlas DAG (8 pipelines / 40 nodes / 114 datasets) with **no server + no network**, and that the `viz` task is registered with the atlas cwd. It never launches the server (headless-safe).

## Invariants

- **AD-1 / AD-6** — `kedro_viz` is visualization glue imported ONLY in this test, never in package code (the src-tree import-ban is untouched). The operator surface is the pixi task, not a package import.

## Tests

`514 passed` (+2 new).
