## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story C2 (4.2): Integrate `kedro-viz` + expose a pixi task

As the operator,
I want the topological DAG rendered by `kedro-viz` behind a dedicated pixi task,
So that I inspect dataset schemas and lineage in the browser instead of reading orchestrator source.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story C2, binding)

**Given** the compiled DAG
**When** `pixi run viz` executes
**Then** it launches the Kedro-Viz server
**And** operators can inspect dataset schemas + data lineage in the browser.

- **FRs:** FR-6 (structural observability), whole-migration AC-3.
- **Invariants:** AD-1, AD-6.
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none (Q2 drained at C1).
- **Verify gate:** `dagster-dryrun` + `kedro-test` (existing gates; viz task smoke lands in the pixi task inventory).
- **Depends on:** C1.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
