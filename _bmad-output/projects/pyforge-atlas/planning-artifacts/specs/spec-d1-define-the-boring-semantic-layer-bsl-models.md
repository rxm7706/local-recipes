## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story D1 (5.1): Define the Boring Semantic Layer (BSL) models

As a downstream consumer (page, MCP read, agent),
I want the 28 read CLIs' metric logic declared once as BSL dimensions + measures over the catalog (Ibis → DuckDB),
So that every read surface translates through one semantic interface with proven metric parity.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story D1, binding)

**Given** the metric/business logic embedded in the 28 read CLIs
**When** the BSL models are declared
**Then** BSL declares the core metrics (staleness, adoption stage, feedstock health, …)
**And** maintainer-role facts (`package_maintainers ⋈ maintainers`) are first-class BSL dimensions — the raw-SQL JOINs live consumers write today become declared queries
**And** the BSL layer is the single translation interface for downstream consumers
**And** a `bsl-metric-check` verify task exists: metric-parity fixtures proving BSL answers match the legacy CLI outputs for the core metrics (the AD-7 metric-semantics handover anchor).

- **FRs:** FR-8.
- **Invariants:** AD-8, AD-4 (Ibis → DuckDB only).
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** **builds `bsl-metric-check`**.
- **Depends on:** Epic 4 (stable orchestrated datasets); B4 (canonical Parquet store).

### Story D2 (5.2): Build the Vizro dashboard + port the 28 CLIs to pages

As the operator,
I want a BSL-driven Vizro app reproducing the 28 read CLIs as pages, including a factory-status page,
So that every read-only question is answerable from a page meeting the agent-legibility bar.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story D2, binding)

**Given** the D1 BSL models and the CIS two-spine design specs
**When** the Vizro app is built
**Then** a Vizro dashboard serves the core KPIs currently locked in CLIs
**And** a "factory status" page reads the BMAD artifact state (sprint-status.yaml, epics frontmatter, `bmad-drift-check --specs` JSON) — agent-readable per § 13.2
**And** each read-only legacy CLI question is answerable from a Vizro page, where for the three FR-9 exceptions (`add-handoff`, `inventory-match`, `library-futures`) "answerable" means the latest-report artifact is surfaced read-only — the bar covers all 28
**And** the live-confirmed consumer set ports first: `behind-upstream`, `query-atlas`, `whodepends`, `feedstock-health`, `my-feedstocks`, `detail-cf-atlas`, `staleness-report`
**And** pages meet the § 2.1 agent-legibility bar (semantic HTML, ARIA, deterministic layouts; NFR-8) and public-facing breadth stays at the factory-status page (SM-C4).

- **FRs:** FR-9.
- **Invariants:** AD-8, AD-17 (authoring-feeding pages carry build timestamps).
- **Mode:** DEV-AUTO (visual judgment, § 9 preamble).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** `bsl-metric-check` (+ `kedro-test`); D2 page inventory detail resolves in the CIS specs (Spine Deferred).
- **Depends on:** D1.

### Story D3 (5.3): Integrate Vizro-AI + expose the NL interface as an MCP tool

As a CFE authoring agent (and the operator),
I want a Vizro-AI natural-language query field and a `query_vizro_ai` MCP tool over the BSL knowledge graph,
So that ad-hoc questions need no SQL and are callable from Claude Code.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story D3, binding)

**Given** the D1 BSL graph and the D2 dashboard
**When** Vizro-AI is integrated
**Then** a natural-language query (e.g. the § 4.3 example) returns a generated chart/insight
**And** the `query_vizro_ai` MCP tool is callable from Claude Code
**And** the LLM backend routes through repo model-backend configuration — never a hardcoded public endpoint (Q3 default).

- **FRs:** FR-9.
- **Invariants:** AD-8, AD-7 (MCP body carries no metric logic).
- **Mode:** ATTENDED (backend boundary event — one of the five § 2.5 attended events).
- **Gating question:** **Q3** (Vizro-AI LLM backend) — § 11 default adopted: route through repo model-backend configuration; defining the `_http.py`-analog LLM routing chain is the real work; bounds: no litellm (py3.14 floor), copilot-api bridge ineligible, llama.cpp/ollama/mlx-lm in-env.
- **Verify gate:** `bsl-metric-check` (existing; NL path verified at the attended event).
- **Depends on:** D1, D2.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
