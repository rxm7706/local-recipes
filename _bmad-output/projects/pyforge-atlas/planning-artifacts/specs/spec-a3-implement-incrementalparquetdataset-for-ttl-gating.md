## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story A3 (2.3): Implement `IncrementalParquetDataset` for TTL gating

As a pipeline node author,
I want the `*_fetched_at` TTL incremental logic encapsulated in one reusable dataset class with per-dataset TTLs,
So that no node ever re-implements checkpoint/TTL/backoff and resumability is Kedro-native.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story A3, binding)

**Given** the catalog from A2
**When** `IncrementalParquetDataset` is implemented
**Then** it exists and round-trips TTL state
**And** a unit test proves stale rows are re-fetched and fresh rows are skipped
**And** TTLs are declared per dataset in the catalog (Phase D 7 d, Phase P 30 d, EPSS 1 d, CWE 90 d, …) — never a global constant (FR-3).

- **FRs:** FR-3, FR-4 (the dataset class is the resumability primitive).
- **Invariants:** AD-5, AD-18 (this story validates the worktree symlink bootstrap and measures worktree env-materialization cost), AD-11.
- **Mode:** LOOP-S — **the designated first loop-driven story and worktree smoke** (§ 2.5 preconditions).
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** `kedro-test` (unit suite; also proves the loop-in-worktree seam before Wave B commits to loop execution).
- **Depends on:** A1, A2.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
