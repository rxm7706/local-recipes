## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story E1 (6.1): Implement the A2A communication interfaces

As a CFE authoring agent,
I want a structured A2A surface between the cf_atlas analytical agent and the conda-forge execution agents,
So that insights, contract violations, and policy breaches arrive as structured payloads, not prose.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story E1, binding)

**Given** the two agents (cf_atlas analytical, `conda-forge-expert` authoring)
**When** the A2A surface is built
**Then** the `cf_atlas` analytical agent can hand a structured payload to the `conda-forge-expert` agent (publish/subscribe or direct-message — transport resolves in this story's spec, Spine Deferred)
**And** payload schemas live in the `a2a/` module — the single schema source for alerts and insights (AD-20)
**And** payloads feeding authoring decisions carry their build timestamp (AD-17).

- **FRs:** FR-11.
- **Invariants:** AD-20 (sole structured inter-agent channel), AD-17.
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none (A2A transport is a story-spec decision, not a Q-gate).
- **Verify gate:** existing gates + payload round-trip fixture in `kedro-test`.
- **Depends on:** B3 (MCP surface), Epic 5 (BSL insights to carry).

### Story E2 (6.2): Integrate OpenLineage + OpenTelemetry

As the operator,
I want Kedro nodes, Dagster runs, and DuckDB queries instrumented with OpenLineage and OTel,
So that lineage, per-node metrics, and end-to-end traces are observable down to specific API calls.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story E2, binding)

**Given** the compiled DAG and hooks layer
**When** instrumentation lands
**Then** lineage + per-node metrics (rows, latency, cache hits) are captured via OpenLineage
**And** end-to-end distributed traces are visible via OTel down to specific API calls
**And** emitted-event/span fixtures are this story's gate assets (AD-20 — fixture-verified, since Wave E has no new named gate).

- **FRs:** FR-12.
- **Invariants:** AD-20, AD-6 (hooks declared in run config — every entry point inherits them, AD-23).
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** existing gates + emitted-event/span fixtures in `kedro-test`.
- **Depends on:** C1 (Dagster runs to instrument).

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
