## Contract (from epics.md — verbatim, authoritative)

### Story G1 (8.1): Compile the intelligence layer to Pyodide / DuckDB-WASM

As a dashboard consumer,
I want the Vizro-AI dashboard + BSL layer running in-browser via Pyodide / DuckDB-WASM,
So that the intelligence surface needs no backend at all.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story G1, binding)

**Given** the D-wave dashboard + BSL layer
**When** the WASM build runs
**Then** the dashboard loads and queries run client-side in the browser with no backend
**And** a `wasm-smoke` verify task exists (Playwright headless load-and-query against the built artifact — Chromium pre-provisioned).

- **FRs:** FR-14.
- **Invariants:** AD-21, AD-11 (gate is the wave's first deliverable).
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** none.
- **Verify gate:** **builds `wasm-smoke`**.
- **Depends on:** Epic 5 (dashboard + BSL), F1 (canonical store).

### Story G2 (8.2): Emit Parquet artifacts to a static web host

As a dashboard consumer,
I want Parquet artifacts published to a static host and pulled via HTTP Range,
So that the WASM runtime reads live data with zero backend.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story G2, binding)

**Given** the G1 WASM runtime
**When** the emitter publishes
**Then** Parquet artifacts are published to the static host (Q4 default: GitHub Pages) and consumed by the WASM runtime via HTTP Range
**And** the emitter is host-agnostic so an enterprise mirror can substitute (Q4)
**And** the published artifact layout (chunking, manifest) has a single owner: this emitter (Spine convention).

- **FRs:** FR-14.
- **Invariants:** AD-21, AD-2 (mirror substitution).
- **Mode:** ATTENDED (publish boundary event — one of the five § 2.5 attended events).
- **Gating question:** **Q4** (WASM artifact host) — § 11 default adopted: GitHub Pages public path; emitter host-agnostic.
- **Verify gate:** **consumes `wasm-smoke`** (against the published artifact at the attended event; fixture-hosted in-loop).
- **Depends on:** G1.

### Story G3 (8.3): Implement Dagster Sensors for near-real-time ingestion

As the operator,
I want the pipeline event-driven via Dagster Sensors on upstream events (PyPI/GitHub webhooks or RSS),
So that ingestion is near-real-time and incremental instead of purely scheduled.

**Acceptance Criteria:** (spec § 9 Story G3, binding)

**Given** the C1 Dagster repository
**When** a simulated upstream event fires
**Then** it triggers the relevant pipeline incrementally via a Dagster Sensor
**And** the event-source choice (webhooks vs RSS) and the persistent-daemon question it drags in (Q2 revisit condition) are resolved and recorded in this story's spec (Spine Deferred).

- **FRs:** FR-6, spec § 5.9.
- **Invariants:** AD-6, AD-23 (sensor-triggered runs ride the same job machinery), AD-5 (incremental via the dataset class).
- **Mode:** LOOP-E.
- **Gating question:** Q2 revisit condition only (daemon footprint — resolves here if sensors require it; not a blocking Q-gate).
- **Verify gate:** `dagster-dryrun` (sensors enumerate) + simulated-event fixture in `kedro-test`.
- **Depends on:** C1, G2 (per § 14 wave order).
- **DELIVERED (2026-07-18 — closes Wave G):** two sensors (`pypi_release_sensor` → Phase H, `vcs_release_sensor` → Phase K) added to C1's `defs` via `orchestration/event_source.py` (dagster-free logic) + `build_upstream_sensor` in `orchestration/definitions.py`; a simulated event → one `RunRequest` for the existing incremental job (AD-23/AD-5), no-event → `SkipReason`. Event source = RSS/poll cursor (not webhooks); live daemon deferred (DW-G3). Gate `test_definitions_dryrun.py` +12; AD-1 import-ban + `dagster definitions validate` green. See spec § 5.9 / Q2.

## Realized in

- **Package:** `src/shared/packages/pyforge-atlas/` (import `pyforge.atlas`).
- **Status:** done + shipped 2026-07-18 (atlas Kedro migration, 32/32; PRs #58–#105 merged to `main`).
- **Verification:** behaviour is covered by the migrated pipeline's tests on `main`. For the
  precise file-level Code Map, read the implementation on `main` — this regenerated spec
  deliberately does not guess a per-file map it cannot verify from the lost original.

## Provenance & recovery note

Recovered 2026-07-25 as part of the spec-durability remediation (see
`planning-artifacts/specs/README.md`). Same root cause + fix as pyforge-warden: story specs
now live tracked in `planning-artifacts/specs/`, not Tier-3 gitignored `implementation-artifacts/`.
