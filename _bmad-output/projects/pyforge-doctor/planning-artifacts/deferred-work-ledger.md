# pyforge-doctor — deferred-work ledger (TRACKED)

**Promoted verbatim from Tier-3 on 2026-07-29 to make it durable.**

`implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md` is **gitignored**: it does not survive a
clone or a bmad-loop worktree teardown, and this repo has already lost data that way
(pyforge-atlas's live ledger is still truncated to 11 of 64 entries, collateral of the
2026-07-19 copy failure). Until today this project had **no tracked ledger at all**, so
its entire deferred-work record — 6 KB — existed only in
scratch space. Found by `scripts/deferred_work_check.py`.

**This is a COPY, not a curation.** Bodies are unedited; nothing has been given a
resolution, re-severitied, or reconciled against what has since shipped. Treat entry
*status* fields as of their authoring date, not as current. The one intentional edit is
id renaming, below.

Durability first; curation is owned follow-up work.

# Deferred Work

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-package-scaffold-frozen-finding-doctorreport-contract-exit-code-module.md`
  summary: The loop's exact `[verify]` command (`pixi run -e pyforge-doctor pyforge-doctor-test`, unfrozen) fails environmentally in every bmad-loop worktree — pixi-build-python 0.8.3 panics (`tools.rs:461` byte-index out-of-bounds) when the build `workDirectory` exceeds ~250 chars (this run's worktree root is 204 chars, over the threshold once nested build-metadata paths are appended). This is the same failure signature already recorded for `pyforge-warden`'s Story 1.1 (`_bmad-output/projects/pyforge-warden/implementation-artifacts/deferred-work.md`), with one added wrinkle: `pyforge-doctor` is a brand-new environment with zero existing `pixi.lock` entries, so `pixi run --frozen -e pyforge-doctor …` (the fix that worked for warden, which already had a solved lock) cannot bootstrap it either — `--frozen` refuses to add missing entries. The environment needs one successful *unfrozen* solve from a short-path checkout (e.g. the main `local-recipes` checkout, not a `.bmad-loop/runs/**/worktrees/**` path) to populate `pixi.lock` with `pyforge-doctor`'s entries; once committed, `--frozen` will work in future worktrees the same way it does for `pyforge-warden`/`pyforge-atlas` today. Recommend: (1) run `pixi install -e pyforge-doctor` (or any `pixi run -e pyforge-doctor …`) once from the main checkout to solve + commit the lock, then (2) switch `.bmad-loop/policy.toml` `[verify]` to `pixi run --frozen -e pyforge-doctor pyforge-doctor-test`.
  evidence: Reproduced on the untouched sibling `pyforge-warden` environment in this same worktree (`pixi run -e pyforge-warden pyforge-warden-test` → identical "the build backend (pixi-build-python) exited prematurely" panic), proving the failure is pre-existing/environmental, not caused by this story's changes — confirmed via `git status`/`git diff --stat` showing only `pixi.toml` (39 lines, no `pixi.lock` churn) and the new untracked `src/shared/packages/pyforge-doctor/` package. Story verification instead used three independent substitutes, all passing: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest tests -q` → 35/35 passed; `python -m build --no-isolation --wheel` → clean wheel containing `data/report-schema.json`, empty `__init__.py`, and an `entry_points.txt` with `doctor = pyforge.doctor.__main__:main`; installing that wheel into a fresh venv and running the real console script (`doctor --version`/`--help`/no-args all exit 0 with correct output, `doctor --bogus` exits 2, no tracebacks).

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-package-scaffold-frozen-finding-doctorreport-contract-exit-code-module.md`
  summary: The team's own auto-memory (`project_bmad_loop_worktree_path_length_limit.md`, updated 2026-07-25 by a concurrent pyforge-herald session) confirms bmad-loop's orchestrator classifies the above pixi-build-python panic as a *code* failure (not `env_fault`, since its return code isn't 126/127) and, with `scm.rollback_on_failure = true`, resets the story branch to `baseline_commit` — discarding a finished, reviewed, green story. This worktree's root path is 239 bytes, well over the ~173-byte panic threshold, so this story's own post-session `pixi run --frozen -e pyforge-doctor pyforge-doctor-test` re-check is expected to hit the identical panic and may trigger the same rollback a third time (attempts 1 and 2 of this exact story were already lost this way — see the Spec Change Log above). Recommend fixing `bmad_loop.verify.ENV_FAULT_RCS`/`verify_commands_outcome` (or the panic's root cause upstream in pixi-build-backends) so this whole panic signature is treated as `env_fault` rather than a per-story code failure.
  evidence: This story's own two prior attempts are direct evidence (dev pass 1 fully implemented + verified 35/35, per the note above, yet the worktree was clean-at-baseline with `sprint-status.yaml` still `backlog` when attempt 3 started — no commit, no `final_revision`, nothing to recover). Cross-confirmed independently by pyforge-herald story 1.2 hitting the same panic class the same day (per the cited memory). If this session's commit is likewise rolled back, recovery is cheap and already on record: `git merge --ff-only <final_revision>` (this commit's parent is the baseline) — see this spec's frontmatter `final_revision` once step 4 commits.

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-package-scaffold-frozen-finding-doctorreport-contract-exit-code-module.md`
  summary: Three uncoordinated version constraints exist for the same `hatchling` build backend across the whole `pyforge-*` package family (unconstrained in each package's `pyproject.toml [build-system] requires`, `>=1.31.0` in the root `pixi.toml`'s `[feature.pyforge-<pkg>.dependencies]`, and `"*"` in each package's own `pixi.toml [package.host-dependencies]`) — nothing ties these together, so the conda build and the wheel/sdist build can silently resolve to different hatchling versions.
  evidence: Pre-existing in `pyforge-warden`'s own three files (identical shape), faithfully mirrored — not introduced by this story. Cross-cutting across `pyforge-warden`/`pyforge-atlas`/`pyforge-doctor`; a fix belongs in a shared follow-up touching all three, not a one-off deviation in this story's scaffold (which is explicitly mandated to mirror warden's shape exactly).

- source_spec: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/spec-1-1-package-scaffold-frozen-finding-doctorreport-contract-exit-code-module.md`
  summary: The AD-2 sole-ownership meta-test's AST exit-literal detector (mirroring `pyforge-warden/tests/meta/test_verdict_sole_ownership.py`'s technique) only matches `ast.Call` nodes, so a bare `raise SystemExit` (or `raise SystemExit(2)` is caught, but a bare `raise SystemExit` with no parens/args is an `ast.Raise` wrapping a plain `Name`, never a `Call`) would evade the guard.
  evidence: Confirmed by direct inspection of the detector's `_is_exit_callable`/`_exit_literal_violations` logic (both here and in the exemplar `pyforge-warden` file it mirrors) — this is an inherited limitation of the exemplar technique itself, not something introduced by this story's implementation; the exemplar's own docstring already states "this is a best-effort STATIC check," so fixing it is a shared cross-package hardening task, not this story's problem.
