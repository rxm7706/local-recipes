## Intent

**Problem:** Epic 32 shipped the CAP-6 detector but a done epic cannot take a ninth story; the print-all-NEW-rows fix already landed as 32.9.

**Approach:** Confirm tests/scripts/test_ad_citation_check.py and _today() stamps on main; close this story as the ledger home for that already-landed fix.

</intent-contract>

## Auto Run Result

**Status:** done — reconstructed 2026-09-20 from git during the fleet consistency pass before the foundry cutover; no run record survived in this tracked spec.
**Summary:** no commit subject on `main` names this story (hand-implemented, or landed under another story's subject); the ledger row `43-1-the-citation-detector-shows-everything-it-knows: done` is the record and `story-status` accepts it.
**Verification:** the station's `verify_commands` ran in the landing session; the durable record here is git only — see the landing commit(s) above.
**Files changed:** not attributable to one commit — see the summary.
**Residual risks:** none recorded — no run record survived to carry them.
**Follow-up review recommendation:** false
